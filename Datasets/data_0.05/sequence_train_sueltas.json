The indication for a bone marrow transplant in MDS is those patients with high or intermediate-2 IPSS, and in this case we do not know the risk, the only thing we know about the risk is the cytogenetics which is of good prognosis that would give us 0 points.

This condition is accompanied by postprandial pain and abdominal distension. A stenosis of the afferent loop has occurred, preventing biliary and pancreatic secretions from mixing with the bolus, causing them to accumulate and produce pain that is relieved by vomiting. This leads to fat malabsorption (due to the lack of pancreatic lipase), resulting in diarrhea. If bacterial overgrowth is present, there is also malabsorption of vitamin B12. The possibility of gastric adenocarcinoma would be indicated by constitutional syndrome and extradigestive manifestations (such as Sister Mary Joseph nodule, Krukenberg tumor, Virchow node), which are not mentioned here.

That is, a version is composed of the sum of two ductions, since duction is the movement of only one eye. When you explore the versions, specifically the superior version or supraversion, both eyes rotate upward. At that time, you may encounter a limitation of the movement of one eye.

The version is always of both eyeballs. It is about a patient who has received a blow. The palpebral hematoma and hyposphagma (subconjunctival hemorrhage) does not give us the key data. The eye that has received the blow does not go up, and therefore there is double vision in the superior gaze.

She has no symptoms, physical examination is unremarkable, chest X-ray is normal. CT scan shows a 3 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe that is captured on PET. No other alterations are observed in CT or PET. What is the most correct approach?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThe current situation suggests probable liver metastasis from a localized colon adenocarcinoma treated 2 years ago. Although histological confirmation is lacking, the likelihood of liver metastasis is high given the circumstances. This represents a case of oligometastasis, and treatments for advanced colon adenocarcinoma can offer prolonged survival with good quality of life. If there are no contraindications to surgery, assessment for surgical resection of the hepatic lesion should be the proper procedure. The algorithm proposed by the NCCN for recurrence situations is provided (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/colon.pdf). In case of an unresectable situation, chemotherapy treatment would be considered with the intention of converting the single metastatic lesion into a resectable one. Since more than 12 months have passed since FOLFOX treatment, the same scheme could be used, although FOLFIRI+bevacizumab would also be useful. Capecitabine monotherapy, in the patient's current situation, would also not be a good starting option, since the responses are lower compared to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus antiangiogenic combinations. Hepatic radiotherapy could be considered, as SBRT techniques show very good results; however, it is advisable to first seek a surgical assessment. If surgery is ruled out, radiotherapy would then be considered.\n\n",

Clinical examination reveals a 1 cm discrepancy in the length of the lower extremities and an attitude of the right lower extremity in external rotation with loss of internal rotation. We should suspect that he presents:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nWe are presented with an adolescent patient who is overweight with pain in the thigh and knee, a length discrepancy of 1 cm and the limb in external rotation. This picture should automatically lead us to mark epiphysiolysis capitis femoris (proximal femoral epiphysiolysis, the fact of reading it in Latin nomina is a bit of a misunderstanding but it should not mislead us). We should think of this one because it is the most frequent and possible. The other options are not impossible but they are less frequent and they would not ask us this if they wanted us to choose another option. If they were sequelae of hip dysplasia, it would not have this 4-month onset and the age of onset would be earlier. Complications of dysplasia are dislocations and subluxations that may require surgery and avascular necrosis of the head. Perthes disease occurs in younger children (4-9 years) with episodes of limping and pain in the hip and knee. In a child the most typical would be a fracture at the level of the physis, not at the level of the femoral neck. This option would be considered with a bone cyst, something that would justify a weakness in the femoral neck area. As for juvenile chronic arthritis, it is a rheumatoid option surrounded by trauma options. There are no rheumatologic factors in an analytical analysis, nor of a polyarticular picture.This could be considered because there is pain in the right knee, but this picture is limited to the right lower limb, there are no other joints or fever or other accompanying systemic symptoms, so it is not an option to evaluate, especially with the other options that would be more likely in view of the picture presented to us.

In view of the diagnostic suspicion, the following conduct is to be followed:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nLet's see: a patient with certain history who has: - Schistocytes in smear: indicates microangiopathic anemia, red cell rupture of mechanical cause, which can be seen mainly in PTT, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and DIC. - Bicytopenia: here the causes can be very, very varied. - Elevation of LDH and Bilirubin, which indicates a massive rupture of red blood cells. - Negative direct Coombs' test: essential data, indicating that there is no antibody that sticks to the red blood cells. Hemorrhagic transformation does not give a brutal elevation of LDH and Cr, and it doesn't explain schistocytosis. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is produced by rupture of red blood cells when they are fragmented by ultralong von Willebrand factor multimers in case of deficiency of the ADAMST13 enzyme, resulting in brutal platelet aggregates and the flow cytometer does not count 400 platelets, but a molondron of platelets that form a mass, hence the thrombocytopenia. It explains the negative direct Coombs, elevated LDH and Cr. The situation of the patient is critical. In DIC it is VERY characteristic the consumption of coagulation factors, which is not present in this case. Myeloma does not give schistocytosis nor does it have this symptomatology.\n\n",
