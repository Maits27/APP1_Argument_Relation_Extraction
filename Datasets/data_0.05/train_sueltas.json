The indication for a bone marrow transplant in MDS is those patients with high or intermediate-2 IPSS, and in this case we do not know the risk, the only thing we know about the risk is the cytogenetics which is of good prognosis that would give us 0 points.

This condition is accompanied by postprandial pain and abdominal distension. A stenosis of the afferent loop has occurred, preventing biliary and pancreatic secretions from mixing with the bolus, causing them to accumulate and produce pain that is relieved by vomiting. This leads to fat malabsorption (due to the lack of pancreatic lipase), resulting in diarrhea. If bacterial overgrowth is present, there is also malabsorption of vitamin B12.

When you explore the versions, specifically the superior version or supraversion, both eyes rotate upward. At that time, you may encounter a limitation of the movement of one eye.

We should suspect that he presents:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nWe are presented with an adolescent patient who is overweight with pain in the thigh and knee, a length discrepancy of 1 cm and the limb in external rotation. This picture should automatically lead us to mark epiphysiolysis capitis femoris (proximal femoral epiphysiolysis, the fact of reading it in Latin nomina is a bit of a misunderstanding but it should not mislead us).

Which of the following statements should you consider regarding this clinical picture?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nIf you have the right intuition when you read it and go straight to what you think, you will probably get it right. The problem is the option of Purstcher's traumatic retinal angiopathy, which can confuse us. There is a blow to the right eye area, with a hematoma on the eyelid. So far so normal. The problem is that retinal hemorrhages appear not only in that eye (which in itself is rare, because an external blow to the eye in a child rarely causes bleeding in the retina), but also in the other eye. Therefore, something other than the blow has caused hemorrhages in both retinas. Then we are told that the child seems drowsy and with little tone. Here we already have the two keys: the shaken baby syndrome (shaken baby syndrome). Characteristic of this syndrome are bilateral retinal hemorrhages, cerebral edema and subdural hematoma. There may also be fracture of long bones and other problems. Numbness and hypotonia allow us to suspect intracranial complications. The cause of shaken baby syndrome is almost always abuse. The options of a normal evolution of a non-perforating intraocular trauma and Berlin edema are easy to rule out: nothing indicates perforating trauma, and it does not explain the hemorrhages in the other eye. And the berlin edema is an edema of the macula and appears as a whitish lesion, which is not described in the statement. Purstcher's retinopathy can also appear in the context of the child of the shaken child, and therefore occur in the case of child abuse. Seeing these two partly related questions, we may hesitate.

It states that the picture described above (intraretinal hemorrhages, without other findings) is characteristic of Purstcher's angiopathy. It is not.

The problem is the option of Purstcher's traumatic retinal angiopathy, which can confuse us. There is a blow to the right eye area, with a hematoma on the eyelid. So far so normal. The problem is that retinal hemorrhages appear not only in that eye (which in itself is rare, because an external blow to the eye in a child rarely causes bleeding in the retina), but also in the other eye. Therefore, something other than the blow has caused hemorrhages in both retinas. Then we are told that the child seems drowsy and with little tone. Here we already have the two keys: the shaken baby syndrome (shaken baby syndrome). Characteristic of this syndrome are bilateral retinal hemorrhages, cerebral edema and subdural hematoma. There may also be fracture of long bones and other problems. Numbness and hypotonia allow us to suspect intracranial complications. The cause of shaken baby syndrome is almost always abuse. The options of a normal evolution of a non-perforating intraocular trauma and Berlin edema are easy to rule out: nothing indicates perforating trauma, and it does not explain the hemorrhages in the other eye. And the berlin edema is an edema of the macula and appears as a whitish lesion, which is not described in the statement. Purstcher's retinopathy can also appear in the context of the child of the shaken child, and therefore occur in the case of child abuse. Seeing these two partly related questions, we may hesitate. However, it does not tell us that if there is child maltreatment Purstcher can occur. It states that the picture described above (intraretinal hemorrhages, without other findings) is characteristic of Purstcher's angiopathy. It is not.

On examination, blood pressure is 156/92 mm Hg. CBC includes a creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, 24-hour urine protein excretion of 1.5 g/day, and a creatinine clearance of 45 ml/min. On this basis, what is the most effective treatment to slow the progression of the patient's type 2 diabetic nephropathy?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nThe antihypertensive drugs that have been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy are the ACE inhibitors and ARAIIs. Specifically, angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated their efficacy in this field for type 2 DM, which together with the side effects that IECAS produce in the patient makes an ARAII the drug of choice.\n\n",

Biomicroscopic examination of the anterior segment shows, after fluorescein staining, a central corneal ulcer in the form of a dendrite. What is the diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nDendritic corneal ulcer is typical of herpes simplex keratitis. It presents with pain, not too striking, and scarce or absent red eye. There are ulcers resembling dendrites that may confuse the diagnosis. These pseudodendrites are found in herpes Zoster and in corneal abrasions in resolution. In those cases we should pay attention to the shape of the dendrite (the true dendrite is deeper and has terminal bulbs at the end of each branch), and pay attention to the evolution of the pain (in the pseudodendrite after abrasion the pain should improve). Fungal and bacterial keratitis have corneal infiltrates. And glaucomatocyclitic crisis (Posner Schlossman syndrome) is a type of idiopathic hypertensive anterior uveitis, which does not present with ulceration.\n\n",

Indicate the best therapeutic option:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nMetallic biliary prosthesis by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, with the option of palliative chemotherapy is the best therapeutic option. Although both lesions are resectable, pancreatic adenocarcinoma with synchronous hepatic metastases has no surgical indication because it does not prolong survival and has a high morbidity. Surgical bypass has more complications than placing a self-expanding metallic prosthesis that has a median patency of 6 months which is similar to the median survival of a patient with hepatic metastases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n",
