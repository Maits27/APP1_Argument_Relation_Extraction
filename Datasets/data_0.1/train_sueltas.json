I write a brief summary of the hungry bone syndrome that I have found in a clinical case in the Annals of Internal Medicine: \"The pathophysiology of the hungry bone syndrome (HBS) is related to an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption, which is associated with hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. This syndrome can be observed after surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), as well as in tertiary HPT of chronic renal failure, and to a lesser extent after treatment of processes with excess of circulating thyroid hormones.

Which of the following decisions do you think is correct?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe patient is a man with pneumonia with isolated germ in blood culture and antibiogram. According to the data provided, it is a pneumococcus sensitive to penicillin (MIC < 0.125), so treatment is started with penicillin at high doses every 4h, despite which the fever persists. The treatment should be effective since the germ is totally sensitive to the drug and the dosage is adequate (so that high concentrations of the drug should be maintained at all times, taking into account that the efficacy of beta-lactams is time-dependent and the antibiotic concentrations in blood should be above the MIC permanently to achieve effectiveness and avoid the production of resistance). Although the antibiotic is the best way to handle this, it is not reaching the infectious focus adequately because an empyema has probably occurred. The existence of an empyema must be discarded and drain it while continuing with the antibiotic treatment. If the dosage had not been adequate and the presence of drug resistance was possible, treating it with ceftriaxone at high doses could be possible, since streptococcus does not produce beta-lactamase and beta-lactam resistance is produced by another mechanism (using amoxicillin-clavulanate would not help).

According to the data provided, it is a pneumococcus sensitive to penicillin (MIC < 0.125), so treatment is started with penicillin at high doses every 4h, despite which the fever persists. The treatment should be effective since the germ is totally sensitive to the drug and the dosage is adequate (so that high concentrations of the drug should be maintained at all times, taking into account that the efficacy of beta-lactams is time-dependent and the antibiotic concentrations in blood should be above the MIC permanently to achieve effectiveness and avoid the production of resistance). Although the antibiotic is the best way to handle this, it is not reaching the infectious focus adequately because an empyema has probably occurred. The existence of an empyema must be discarded and drain it while continuing with the antibiotic treatment.

Medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers to avoid angina is one approach, although I miss statins, ACE inhibitors and antiplatelet agents, and I have too many vasodilators (nitrates are class IIb, if my memory serves me correctly). Sitting down to avoid angina is another option but not practical for long-term management. Since it is a single vessel and not a proximal LAD, revascularization would have to be percutaneous, so we discard surgical revascularization. Between dilatation of the coronary artery lesion by therapeutic catheterization, and therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area, the second is more complete: not only would it be necessary to dilate, but also to implant a stent. So the doubt would be between medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers, and therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area. \nApplying the general rules of response in the MIR, if two options are similar except in one detail, the correct one is one of these, so we would choose the second one (and this is what would be done in any hospital nowadays: a suboccluded artery is dilated directly).\n\n",

Twenty days after starting treatment, a report of rifampicin resistance of M. tuberculosis isolated in sputum is received.

If resistance to rifampicin is detected, rifampicin is withdrawn, and treatment continues with the remaining three drugs for 12 months.

Indeed, a hematoma is observed on the right eyelid, apparently of no importance. The fundus examination showed intraretinal hemorrhages not only in the eye referred by the parents but also in the other eye. It is noteworthy that the child appears drowsy and with little tone. Which of the following statements should you consider regarding this clinical picture?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nIf you have the right intuition when you read it and go straight to what you think, you will probably get it right. The problem is the option of Purstcher's traumatic retinal angiopathy, which can confuse us. There is a blow to the right eye area, with a hematoma on the eyelid. So far so normal. The problem is that retinal hemorrhages appear not only in that eye (which in itself is rare, because an external blow to the eye in a child rarely causes bleeding in the retina), but also in the other eye. Therefore, something other than the blow has caused hemorrhages in both retinas. Then we are told that the child seems drowsy and with little tone. Here we already have the two keys: the shaken baby syndrome (shaken baby syndrome). Characteristic of this syndrome are bilateral retinal hemorrhages, cerebral edema and subdural hematoma. There may also be fracture of long bones and other problems. Numbness and hypotonia allow us to suspect intracranial complications. The cause of shaken baby syndrome is almost always abuse. The options of a normal evolution of a non-perforating intraocular trauma and Berlin edema are easy to rule out: nothing indicates perforating trauma, and it does not explain the hemorrhages in the other eye. And the berlin edema is an edema of the macula and appears as a whitish lesion, which is not described in the statement. Purstcher's retinopathy can also appear in the context of the child of the shaken child, and therefore occur in the case of child abuse. Seeing these two partly related questions, we may hesitate. However, it does not tell us that if there is child maltreatment Purstcher can occur. It states that the picture described above (intraretinal hemorrhages, without other findings) is characteristic of Purstcher's angiopathy. It is not. In Purstcher's there are hemorrhages, but also cottony exudates and edema. If there are only hemorrhages, it's not Purstcher's.

This picture should automatically lead us to mark epiphysiolysis capitis femoris (proximal femoral epiphysiolysis, the fact of reading it in Latin nomina is a bit of a misunderstanding but it should not mislead us).

There are no rheumatologic factors in an analytical analysis, nor of a polyarticular picture.This could be considered because there is pain in the right knee, but this picture is limited to the right lower limb, there are no other joints or fever or other accompanying systemic symptoms, so it is not an option to evaluate, especially with the other options that would be more likely in view of the picture presented to us.

She feels well but states that she has stopped taking verapamil because of constipation. She presents with intolerance to ACE inhibitors due to coughing. On examination, blood pressure is 156/92 mm Hg. CBC includes a creatinine of 1.6 mg/dL, 24-hour urine protein excretion of 1.5 g/day, and a creatinine clearance of 45 ml/min. On this basis, what is the most effective treatment to slow the progression of the patient's type 2 diabetic nephropathy?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nThe antihypertensive drugs that have been shown to slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy are the ACE inhibitors and ARAIIs. Specifically, angiotensin II receptor blockers have demonstrated their efficacy in this field for type 2 DM, which together with the side effects that IECAS produce in the patient makes an ARAII the drug of choice.\n\n",

She had previously been diagnosed with acute pharyngitis and was treated with amoxicillin, and later presented with a generalized macular skin rash. Laboratory tests showed slight leukocytosis and presence of activated leukocytes, slight thrombopenia and slightly increased transaminases. What would be the most likely diagnosis of this clinical picture?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nIt is a typical picture of infectious mononucleosis. Although a similar picture may occur in acute toxoplasmosis, less than 1% of acute toxoplasma infections present as mononucleosis. Characteristic of Epstein-Barr infectious mononucleosis is the appearance of macular rash after treatment with amoxicillin.\n\n",
