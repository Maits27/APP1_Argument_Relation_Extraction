Medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers to avoid angina is one approach, although I miss statins, ACE inhibitors and antiplatelet agents, and I have too many vasodilators (nitrates are class IIb, if my memory serves me correctly). Sitting down to avoid angina is another option but not practical for long-term management. Since it is a single vessel and not a proximal LAD, revascularization would have to be percutaneous, so we discard surgical revascularization. Between dilatation of the coronary artery lesion by therapeutic catheterization, and therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area, the second is more complete: not only would it be necessary to dilate, but also to implant a stent.

On examination he presents significant palpebral hematoma, hyposphagmia, diplopia to superior vision with limitation of the upper version of the eyeball. What would you suspect?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nVersions are bilateral conjugated movements of both eyes. That is, a version is composed of the sum of two ductions, since duction is the movement of only one eye. When you explore the versions, specifically the superior version or supraversion, both eyes rotate upward. At that time, you may encounter a limitation of the movement of one eye. In this case, when you scan the supraversion, you suspect or you detect a limitation in the movement of the left eye. And we would call this a limitation to the supraversion of that eye. The version is always of both eyeballs. It is about a patient who has received a blow. The palpebral hematoma and hyposphagma (subconjunctival hemorrhage) does not give us the key data. The eye that has received the blow does not go up, and therefore there is double vision in the superior gaze. Because the superior rectus is trapped, it does not work and therefore the eye cannot go up. However, muscles trapped in a fracture do not automatically lose their muscular action. What happens is that they become trapped, they are \"hooked\", and cannot stretch. The problem is that the inferior wall has been broken, the inferior rectus has been trapped, and when the eye must look up, this inferior rectus cannot stretch as it should. It is not paralysis, but a restrictive problem. Zygomatic arch fracture and dentoalveolar fracture are too far away from the extraocular muscles to produce diplopia.

Medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers to avoid angina is one approach, although I miss statins, ACE inhibitors and antiplatelet agents, and I have too many vasodilators (nitrates are class IIb, if my memory serves me correctly). Sitting down to avoid angina is another option but not practical for long-term management. Since it is a single vessel and not a proximal LAD, revascularization would have to be percutaneous, so we discard surgical revascularization. Between dilatation of the coronary artery lesion by therapeutic catheterization, and therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area, the second is more complete: not only would it be necessary to dilate, but also to implant a stent.

What would be the interpretation you would make of the arterial blood gas and what treatment would you use?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe initial clinical data lacks gasometry, and the subsequent blood gas results are provided without accompanying clinical context, making it impossible to assess the patient's progression under the current treatment. Therefore, determining the appropriate course of action is not feasible. If the patient initially presented with a blood gas pH of 7.05 and now has the reported values (though the time interval between measurements is not specified), the treatment appears effective, suggesting the continuation of the current approach might be beneficial. Conversely, if the patient's condition has not evolved, the clinical picture remains unchanged, and the initial blood gas was similar, adjustments should be considered (also depending on the patient's baseline status, which is also not provided). In this scenario, initiating ventilation rather than theophylline might be considered, although given the minimal pH alteration (particularly if this is a chronic patient with a baseline blood gas similar to the presented values), this could be perceived as excessive. There is no explicit contraindication against theophylline provided, but its use has become rare. The patient appears to have a retentive condition, and increasing oxygen flow is likely to exacerbate hypercapnia and acidosis, but initiating noninvasive mechanical ventilation could be a correct approach. It is not a metabolic acidosis, as bicarbonate levels are not decreased; they are slightly elevated, indicating compensation for respiratory acidosis. The patient does not meet the definition of respiratory failure (pO2 60), but presents with hypercapnia and slight acidosis. If the initial blood gas data indicated a much worse condition and significant improvement has been noted, maintaining the same medication could be justified, but this information is missing.

On examination he presents significant palpebral hematoma, hyposphagmia, diplopia to superior vision with limitation of the upper version of the eyeball. What would you suspect?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nVersions are bilateral conjugated movements of both eyes. That is, a version is composed of the sum of two ductions, since duction is the movement of only one eye. When you explore the versions, specifically the superior version or supraversion, both eyes rotate upward. At that time, you may encounter a limitation of the movement of one eye. In this case, when you scan the supraversion, you suspect or you detect a limitation in the movement of the left eye. And we would call this a limitation to the supraversion of that eye. The version is always of both eyeballs. It is about a patient who has received a blow. The palpebral hematoma and hyposphagma (subconjunctival hemorrhage) does not give us the key data. The eye that has received the blow does not go up, and therefore there is double vision in the superior gaze. Because the superior rectus is trapped, it does not work and therefore the eye cannot go up. However, muscles trapped in a fracture do not automatically lose their muscular action. What happens is that they become trapped, they are \"hooked\", and cannot stretch. The problem is that the inferior wall has been broken, the inferior rectus has been trapped, and when the eye must look up, this inferior rectus cannot stretch as it should. It is not paralysis, but a restrictive problem. Zygomatic arch fracture and dentoalveolar fracture are too far away from the extraocular muscles to produce diplopia. And as for the walls of the orbit, the ones that break most frequently are the inferior and medial wall. The superior wall ruptures very rarely.\n\n",

Medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers to avoid angina is one approach, although I miss statins, ACE inhibitors and antiplatelet agents, and I have too many vasodilators (nitrates are class IIb, if my memory serves me correctly). Sitting down to avoid angina is another option but not practical for long-term management. Since it is a single vessel and not a proximal LAD, revascularization would have to be percutaneous, so we discard surgical revascularization. Between dilatation of the coronary artery lesion by therapeutic catheterization, and therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area, the second is more complete: not only would it be necessary to dilate, but also to implant a stent. So the doubt would be between medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers, and therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area. \nApplying the general rules of response in the MIR, if two options are similar except in one detail, the correct one is one of these, so we would choose the second one (and this is what would be done in any hospital nowadays: a suboccluded artery is dilated directly).\n\n",

The patient says goodbye to the stretcher-bearer with a handshake and a simultaneous pat on the shoulder. Rotation of the lower limbs on the stretcher grasped by the ankles is painless and compression of the pelvis is asymptomatic. Next:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe should palpate the abdomen and roll en bloc to palpate the thoracolumbar spine. The patient, due to the mechanism of injury (foot fall), the calcaneal fracture and the neurological symptoms, suggests a low spinal cord injury due to a fracture of the lumbar spine. The injury is not high because he moves his arms. It also does not appear to be a pelvic injury because of the absence of pain on mobilization or palpation. If there is a suspicion of pelvic injury in the primary evaluation of all polytraumatized (ATLS) a spinal exploration should be performed by rotating the spine en bloc to avoid producing more injury. Abdominal palpation is also part of the initial evaluation. Abdominal ultrasound may be indicated in hemodynamically unstable patients if abdominal injuries are suspected but in any case it is done after the initial evaluation.\n\n",

The patient responds well to initial treatment with intravenous calcium and later with oral calcium and vitamin D. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nPermanent post-surgical hypoparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy of an adenoma with minimally invasive surgery is rare. I write a brief summary of the hungry bone syndrome that I have found in a clinical case in the Annals of Internal Medicine: \"The pathophysiology of the hungry bone syndrome (HBS) is related to an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption, which is associated with hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia. This syndrome can be observed after surgery in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT), as well as in tertiary HPT of chronic renal failure, and to a lesser extent after treatment of processes with excess of circulating thyroid hormones. In PTH, there is an excess of parathyroid hormone (PTH) which stimulates osteoclastic activity causing demineralization of the bone matrix and releasing calcium into the bloodstream. After parathyroidectomy, serum PTH levels drop dramatically, thus, PTH-induced bone resorption ceases, while osteoblastic activity continues resulting in increased bone uptake of calcium, phosphate and magnesium, thus SHH appears.\"\n\n",

Laboratory data: hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL ferritin 450 ng/mL erythrocyte sedimentation rate 115 mm/h.

What would be the interpretation you would make of the arterial blood gas and what treatment would you use?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe initial clinical data lacks gasometry, and the subsequent blood gas results are provided without accompanying clinical context, making it impossible to assess the patient's progression under the current treatment. Therefore, determining the appropriate course of action is not feasible. If the patient initially presented with a blood gas pH of 7.05 and now has the reported values (though the time interval between measurements is not specified), the treatment appears effective, suggesting the continuation of the current approach might be beneficial. Conversely, if the patient's condition has not evolved, the clinical picture remains unchanged, and the initial blood gas was similar, adjustments should be considered (also depending on the patient's baseline status, which is also not provided). In this scenario, initiating ventilation rather than theophylline might be considered, although given the minimal pH alteration (particularly if this is a chronic patient with a baseline blood gas similar to the presented values), this could be perceived as excessive. There is no explicit contraindication against theophylline provided, but its use has become rare. The patient appears to have a retentive condition, and increasing oxygen flow is likely to exacerbate hypercapnia and acidosis, but initiating noninvasive mechanical ventilation could be a correct approach. It is not a metabolic acidosis, as bicarbonate levels are not decreased; they are slightly elevated, indicating compensation for respiratory acidosis. The patient does not meet the definition of respiratory failure (pO2 60), but presents with hypercapnia and slight acidosis. If the initial blood gas data indicated a much worse condition and significant improvement has been noted, maintaining the same medication could be justified, but this information is missing.

This means that we can do nothing with an arthroscopy, let alone a synovectomy. The genu varum could falsely make us think about an osteotomy, however even if we did it and corrected the varus now the damage is already done and the osteoarthrosis is severe. Perhaps years ago before the osteoarthritis took place it would have been resolutive but not now. In addition, in order to consider an osteotomy,  more data is needed to know which bone to apply the osteotomy on, the tibia or the femur. Finally, it might be considered best to first try rehabilitation before considering surgery, but this procedure is discarded because we have exhausted pharmacological measures. In any case with the knee prosthesis we correct the problem of osteoarthritis pain and we can also correct the knee varus.\n\n",

Medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers to avoid angina is one approach, although I miss statins, ACE inhibitors and antiplatelet agents, and I have too many vasodilators (nitrates are class IIb, if my memory serves me correctly). Sitting down to avoid angina is another option but not practical for long-term management. Since it is a single vessel and not a proximal LAD, revascularization would have to be percutaneous, so we discard surgical revascularization. Between dilatation of the coronary artery lesion by therapeutic catheterization, and therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area, the second is more complete: not only would it be necessary to dilate, but also to implant a stent. So the doubt would be between medical management with vasodilators and beta-blockers, and therapeutic catheterization to dilate the lesion of the diseased artery and implantation of a stent in the dilated area. \nApplying the general rules of response in the MIR, if two options are similar except in one detail, the correct one is one of these, so we would choose the second one (and this is what would be done in any hospital nowadays: a suboccluded artery is dilated directly).\n\n",

This condition is accompanied by postprandial pain and abdominal distension. A stenosis of the afferent loop has occurred, preventing biliary and pancreatic secretions from mixing with the bolus, causing them to accumulate and produce pain that is relieved by vomiting. This leads to fat malabsorption (due to the lack of pancreatic lipase), resulting in diarrhea. If bacterial overgrowth is present, there is also malabsorption of vitamin B12. The possibility of gastric adenocarcinoma would be indicated by constitutional syndrome and extradigestive manifestations (such as Sister Mary Joseph nodule, Krukenberg tumor, Virchow node), which are not mentioned here.

Although histological confirmation is lacking, the likelihood of liver metastasis is high given the circumstances. This represents a case of oligometastasis, and treatments for advanced colon adenocarcinoma can offer prolonged survival with good quality of life. If there are no contraindications to surgery, assessment for surgical resection of the hepatic lesion should be the proper procedure. The algorithm proposed by the NCCN for recurrence situations is provided (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/colon.pdf). In case of an unresectable situation, chemotherapy treatment would be considered with the intention of converting the single metastatic lesion into a resectable one. Since more than 12 months have passed since FOLFOX treatment, the same scheme could be used, although FOLFIRI+bevacizumab would also be useful. Capecitabine monotherapy, in the patient's current situation, would also not be a good starting option, since the responses are lower compared to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus antiangiogenic combinations.

On examination he presents significant palpebral hematoma, hyposphagmia, diplopia to superior vision with limitation of the upper version of the eyeball. What would you suspect?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nVersions are bilateral conjugated movements of both eyes. That is, a version is composed of the sum of two ductions, since duction is the movement of only one eye. When you explore the versions, specifically the superior version or supraversion, both eyes rotate upward. At that time, you may encounter a limitation of the movement of one eye. In this case, when you scan the supraversion, you suspect or you detect a limitation in the movement of the left eye. And we would call this a limitation to the supraversion of that eye. The version is always of both eyeballs. It is about a patient who has received a blow. The palpebral hematoma and hyposphagma (subconjunctival hemorrhage) does not give us the key data. The eye that has received the blow does not go up, and therefore there is double vision in the superior gaze. Because the superior rectus is trapped, it does not work and therefore the eye cannot go up. However, muscles trapped in a fracture do not automatically lose their muscular action. What happens is that they become trapped, they are \"hooked\", and cannot stretch. The problem is that the inferior wall has been broken, the inferior rectus has been trapped, and when the eye must look up, this inferior rectus cannot stretch as it should. It is not paralysis, but a restrictive problem. Zygomatic arch fracture and dentoalveolar fracture are too far away from the extraocular muscles to produce diplopia. And as for the walls of the orbit, the ones that break most frequently are the inferior and medial wall. The superior wall ruptures very rarely.\n\n",

He also refers to having been visited by different specialists and provides a head and neck CAT scan (without iodine contrast) which is reported as normal. On examination there was a decrease in the propulsive capacity of the tongue; palpation of the base of the left tongue showed an induration of stony consistency of approximately 3cm and with indirect laryngoscopy no ulceration of the mucosa was observed. Cervical palpation is negative for lymphadenopathy. What is your presumptive diagnosis and course of action?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nWe are presented with a patient with risk factors for oropharyngeal cancer, but in whom the examination and tests are normal. The dentist \"didn't see anything\" about a posible dental problem. It is not an abscess of the base of the tongue either, because in three months it would have killed the patient.  Regarding Ankyloglossia, Ankyloglossia is a tongue base cancer with non-specific inflammation. When there is doubt that it could be cancer order a new CT scan and biopsy. Tongue base cancers are very treacherous and it is one of the fears of any otolaryngologist when he suspects a neoplasm. It is not uncommon for them to arise without exophytic masses or ulcerations of the tongue mucosa and they are difficult to detect on CT when contrast is not used. \n\n",

Hemorrhagic transformation does not give a brutal elevation of LDH and Cr, and it doesn't explain schistocytosis. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is produced by rupture of red blood cells when they are fragmented by ultralong von Willebrand factor multimers in case of deficiency of the ADAMST13 enzyme, resulting in brutal platelet aggregates and the flow cytometer does not count 400 platelets, but a molondron of platelets that form a mass, hence the thrombocytopenia.

In an ambulatory electrocardiogram recording during 24 hours, short phases of absence of P waves prior to QRS with an escape rhythm of the atrioventricular junction with narrow QRS at 40 bpm and a wave at the beginning of the ST segment corresponding to a retrograde P were detected in the vigil period.

If the sinus node fails, the AV node takes over and stimulates the ventricle. In 10% of people there is retrograde conduction, so that beat generated in the AVN stimulates both ventricles and atria, giving a retrograde P as reported in the study. In this sense, no problem. Likewise, there are also no pauses longer than 3 seconds that could cause cardiogenic syncope (which, in fact, he has never suffered). Option 1 is ruled out: it is not a complete AVB. Option 2 cannot be answered either: to exclude, what is said to exclude... It is like never/always. Option 3 does not make much sense: we could suspend those that impair conduction (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists), but drugs that facilitate, as long as we do not give him a perfusion of atropine to take home... In option 4, stating that he has sinoatrial block is a bit of a rap: without an electrophysiological study it cannot be said, he does not necessarily have SA block, and this alone would not indicate the implantation of a pacemaker.

On examination there was a decrease in the propulsive capacity of the tongue; palpation of the base of the left tongue showed an induration of stony consistency of approximately 3cm and with indirect laryngoscopy no ulceration of the mucosa was observed. Cervical palpation is negative for lymphadenopathy. What is your presumptive diagnosis and course of action?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nWe are presented with a patient with risk factors for oropharyngeal cancer, but in whom the examination and tests are normal. The dentist \"didn't see anything\" about a posible dental problem. It is not an abscess of the base of the tongue either, because in three months it would have killed the patient.  Regarding Ankyloglossia, Ankyloglossia is a tongue base cancer with non-specific inflammation. When there is doubt that it could be cancer order a new CT scan and biopsy. Tongue base cancers are very treacherous and it is one of the fears of any otolaryngologist when he suspects a neoplasm. It is not uncommon for them to arise without exophytic masses or ulcerations of the tongue mucosa and they are difficult to detect on CT when contrast is not used. \n\n",

Since a prolonged and high-dose prednisone regimen will be established, it is advisable, in addition to the non-pharmacological preventive measures, to initiate treatment in any case to minimize the secondary loss of bone mass that occurs with the administration of glucocorticoids in the first months. In the case of a person over 65 years of age, an appropriate attitude would be to administer calcium supplements, corticosteroids are osteopenizantes, because they produce, among other mechanisms, a negative balance of this element and vitamin D.
