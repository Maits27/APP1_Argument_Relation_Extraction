After parathyroidectomy, serum PTH levels drop dramatically, thus, PTH-induced bone resorption ceases, while osteoblastic activity continues resulting in increased bone uptake of calcium, phosphate and magnesium, thus SHH appears.\"\n\n",

        "premise": "QUESTION TYPE: ENDOCRINOLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 55-year-old woman consults for fatigue and polyuria of two years' evolution. Laboratory tests reveal hypercalcemia, increased PTH and increased bone turnover markers. The radiographic study shows subperiosteal resorption and osteoporosis. Sestamibi scintigraphy revealed a parathyroid adenoma. Parathyroidectomy was performed with minimally invasive surgery. Postoperatively, the patient developed severe hypocalcemia and tetany, with PTH below 5 ng/l. The patient responds well to initial treatment with intravenous calcium and later with oral calcium and vitamin D. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nPermanent post-surgical hypoparathyroidism after parathyroidectomy of an adenoma with minimally invasive surgery is rare. I write a brief summary of the hungry bone syndrome that I have found in a clinical case in the Annals of Internal Medicine: \"The pathophysiology of the hungry bone syndrome (HBS) is related to an imbalance between bone formation and bone resorption, which is associated with hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and hypomagnesemia.

The determination of anti-GBM antibodies and ANCAS are helpful for diagnosis, but they do not replace renal biopsy, since they lack prognostic value and do not help to plan treatment. In this case, in which we are led to think that renal biopsy is not possible, we must relate AE to renal failure. In most cases, the relationship is established by an IgA nephropathy, which presents with hematuria, a symptom that claims not to exist in this case. A non-negligible number of patients with evolved AD is amyloidosis, which also matches the patient's symptomatology. Amyloidosis can be diagnosed with a subcutaneous fat biopsy.\n\n",

It is mandatory to ensure firstly that it is truly asthma and not another disease that simulates asthma, secondly that there are no complications that worsen the evolution as could be the presence of gastroesophageal reflux, bronchiectasis, presence of opportunistic germs given the chronic treatment with steroids, etc; and thirdly, it is necessary to confirm that the patient complies with the treatments correctly, especially the inhaled treatment, etc. Once all of the above has been checked, it would be time to start a trial treatment with omalizumab.\n\n",

The most likely rationale for these findings is due to:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nWe are being presented with a patient with Stauffer's syndrome, a paraneoplastic syndrome consisting of liver dysfunction secondary to toxic products secreted by a number of tumors (most frequently, renal cell carcinoma, like the one in this case). As in this case, cholestasis (elevation of alkaline phosphatase), mobilization of hepatic enzymes and lengthening of the prothrombin time indicate liver dysfunction. Matastases produce hepatic infiltration which are not present in the clinical case. Intrahepatic tumor thrombosis leads to acute pains and acute hepatitis and hemochromatosis are not related to the clinical picture.\n\n",

He is currently asymptomatic with a CD4 count above 200 cls/microliter. Which vaccines should we recommend?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nVaccination recommendations for HIV+ adults include hepatitis B, influenza, MMR, pneumococcal, Td and Tdap, and for some adults, hepatitis A, or combined A and B, bacterial meningitis, HPV and meningococcal. Considering that the individual has received some vaccines, has a CD4 count >100 (if lower there would be a contraindication) and works in a center that helps AIDS patients (he is equated to \"health personnel\"). All four vaccines (Seasonal influenza, pneumococcal, tetravalent meningitis and hepatitis A) are administrable. In a little more detail: Vaccine against tetanus and diphtheria: all persons should be vaccinated against these two diseases. Hepatitis B vaccine: hepatitis B and HIV viruses share the same routes of transmission, so it is common for HIV-infected patients to also be infected with hepatitis B virus. It is therefore important to know whether the HIV-infected person has markers of hepatitis B infection and to proceed with vaccination if he/she does not have them. Vaccination against hepatitis A: Hepatitis A in a person with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or other liver disease can be very serious. Since these infections are more frequent in HIV-infected patients, vaccination against hepatitis A is recommended. Vaccination against influenza: influenza in a patient with a lack of immune response is more serious and presents a greater risk of complications, so annual vaccination against this disease is indicated. If the patient's immune status is very deteriorated, the response to vaccination is diminished. In this case, it is essential to vaccinate all the people living with the HIV-infected person to prevent them from transmitting the disease. Pneumococcal vaccine: pneumococcal infections (especially pneumonia) are up to 10 times more frequent in HIV-infected persons than in HIV-uninfected adults, so vaccination is recommended, although in patients with counts below 200/mm3 the protective response is usually not sufficient. They should receive a second dose at 3-5 years of age. HIV-infected children should be vaccinated with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with the corresponding number of doses according to age. Vaccination against Haemophilus Influenzae type b: this bacterium causes pneumonia and meningitis, especially in children. Although in HIV-infected adults it represents a small number of the causes of infection, vaccination is recommended.

In 10% of people there is retrograde conduction, so that beat generated in the AVN stimulates both ventricles and atria, giving a retrograde P as reported in the study. In this sense, no problem. Likewise, there are also no pauses longer than 3 seconds that could cause cardiogenic syncope (which, in fact, he has never suffered). Option 1 is ruled out: it is not a complete AVB. Option 2 cannot be answered either: to exclude, what is said to exclude... It is like never/always. Option 3 does not make much sense: we could suspend those that impair conduction (beta-blockers, calcium antagonists), but drugs that facilitate, as long as we do not give him a perfusion of atropine to take home... In option 4, stating that he has sinoatrial block is a bit of a rap: without an electrophysiological study it cannot be said, he does not necessarily have SA block, and this alone would not indicate the implantation of a pacemaker. So, finally, I would check option 5.\n",

The treatment should be effective since the germ is totally sensitive to the drug and the dosage is adequate (so that high concentrations of the drug should be maintained at all times, taking into account that the efficacy of beta-lactams is time-dependent and the antibiotic concentrations in blood should be above the MIC permanently to achieve effectiveness and avoid the production of resistance). Although the antibiotic is the best way to handle this, it is not reaching the infectious focus adequately because an empyema has probably occurred. The existence of an empyema must be discarded and drain it while continuing with the antibiotic treatment. If the dosage had not been adequate and the presence of drug resistance was possible, treating it with ceftriaxone at high doses could be possible, since streptococcus does not produce beta-lactamase and beta-lactam resistance is produced by another mechanism (using amoxicillin-clavulanate would not help).

Blood cultures and a urine culture were negative, CSF was normal and the chest x-ray showed no infiltrates. Procalcitonin is normal, but CRP and ferritin are very elevated. Of the following statements, which would be the most correct diagnostic and therapeutic approach?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\n The patient is a 16-year-old male who is admitted for a fairly clear case of mononucleosis due to EBV infection that becomes complicated during admission. The data available to us are: - Pancytopenia. - Hepatopathy. - Coagulopathy. - Absence of infectious focus: negative blood cultures, negative urine cultures, normal X-ray, normal CSF. - CRP and Ferritin elevated / normal Procalcitonin. The possible complications that could have occurred  are sepsis or a bad evolution of mononucleosis. The clinical data could be consistent with a septic process, however, the main infectious foci have been reasonably ruled out and one of the most sensitive and specific markers of bacteremia (procalcitonin) is in the normal range, which should draw our attention. On the other hand, a complication of the EBV mononucleosis suffered by our patient should be evaluated, among the possible complications are hemolytic anemia, meningoecephalitis (normal CSF) or Guillain-Barré sd. Guillain-Barré syndrome, which are not very consistent with the clinical picture presented to us. Another possible complication of exceptional severity would be hemophagocytic syndrome; this is a rare entity that occurs in certain predisposed subjects and is characterized by an uncontrolled activation and proliferation of histiocytes and T lymphocytes, which produces a state of hypercytokinemia.  The diagnostic criteria, revised in 2004, include persistent high fever, hepatosplenomegaly, cytopenias, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperferritinemia, and hypofibrinogenemia.

        "premise": "QUESTION TYPE: GENERAL SURGERY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nPoint out from among the following the most likely complication presented by a patient operated, 20 years ago, of gastric ulcer by antrectomy and gastrojejunostomy (Billroth II) who comes to your office referring postpradial abdominal pain, abdominal distension, diarrhea and analytical data of malabsorption of fats and vitamin B12:\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe statement describes the clinical features of afferent loop syndrome, which is typically a late complication (the patient underwent a Bilroth II surgery 20 years ago, which is a partial gastrectomy, closure of the gastric stump, and anastomosis of the first jejunal loop to the stump). This condition is accompanied by postprandial pain and abdominal distension. A stenosis of the afferent loop has occurred, preventing biliary and pancreatic secretions from mixing with the bolus, causing them to accumulate and produce pain that is relieved by vomiting. This leads to fat malabsorption (due to the lack of pancreatic lipase), resulting in diarrhea. If bacterial overgrowth is present, there is also malabsorption of vitamin B12. The possibility of gastric adenocarcinoma would be indicated by constitutional syndrome and extradigestive manifestations (such as Sister Mary Joseph nodule, Krukenberg tumor, Virchow node), which are not mentioned here. Dumping is unlikely as there is no mention of vegetative symptoms (like palpitations and facial flushing). Biliary reflux gastropathy requires an endoscopic diagnosis and is not typically associated with diarrhea or malabsorption.\n\n",

That is, a version is composed of the sum of two ductions, since duction is the movement of only one eye.

The version is always of both eyeballs. It is about a patient who has received a blow. The palpebral hematoma and hyposphagma (subconjunctival hemorrhage) does not give us the key data. The eye that has received the blow does not go up, and therefore there is double vision in the superior gaze. Because the superior rectus is trapped, it does not work and therefore the eye cannot go up. However, muscles trapped in a fracture do not automatically lose their muscular action. What happens is that they become trapped, they are \"hooked\", and cannot stretch. The problem is that the inferior wall has been broken, the inferior rectus has been trapped, and when the eye must look up, this inferior rectus cannot stretch as it should. It is not paralysis, but a restrictive problem. Zygomatic arch fracture and dentoalveolar fracture are too far away from the extraocular muscles to produce diplopia. And as for the walls of the orbit, the ones that break most frequently are the inferior and medial wall. The superior wall ruptures very rarely.\n\n",

After receiving treatment with oxygen at low concentrations, bronchodilators and coticoids, a second arterial blood gas with 28% inspiratory oxygen fraction shows a pH of 7.32, pO2 61 mmHg, pCO2 58 mmHg, HCO3- 29 mmol/l. What would be the interpretation you would make of the arterial blood gas and what treatment would you use?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe initial clinical data lacks gasometry, and the subsequent blood gas results are provided without accompanying clinical context, making it impossible to assess the patient's progression under the current treatment. Therefore, determining the appropriate course of action is not feasible. If the patient initially presented with a blood gas pH of 7.05 and now has the reported values (though the time interval between measurements is not specified), the treatment appears effective, suggesting the continuation of the current approach might be beneficial. Conversely, if the patient's condition has not evolved, the clinical picture remains unchanged, and the initial blood gas was similar, adjustments should be considered (also depending on the patient's baseline status, which is also not provided). In this scenario, initiating ventilation rather than theophylline might be considered, although given the minimal pH alteration (particularly if this is a chronic patient with a baseline blood gas similar to the presented values), this could be perceived as excessive. There is no explicit contraindication against theophylline provided, but its use has become rare. The patient appears to have a retentive condition, and increasing oxygen flow is likely to exacerbate hypercapnia and acidosis, but initiating noninvasive mechanical ventilation could be a correct approach. It is not a metabolic acidosis, as bicarbonate levels are not decreased; they are slightly elevated, indicating compensation for respiratory acidosis. The patient does not meet the definition of respiratory failure (pO2 60), but presents with hypercapnia and slight acidosis. If the initial blood gas data indicated a much worse condition and significant improvement has been noted, maintaining the same medication could be justified, but this information is missing. Currently, in the absence of formal contraindications, intravenous aminophylline is not commonly used.\n\n",

In a routine control, two years later, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) elevation to 30 ng/mL (previously less than 2 ng/mL) was detected.

Although histological confirmation is lacking, the likelihood of liver metastasis is high given the circumstances. This represents a case of oligometastasis, and treatments for advanced colon adenocarcinoma can offer prolonged survival with good quality of life. If there are no contraindications to surgery, assessment for surgical resection of the hepatic lesion should be the proper procedure. The algorithm proposed by the NCCN for recurrence situations is provided (http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/pdf/colon.pdf). In case of an unresectable situation, chemotherapy treatment would be considered with the intention of converting the single metastatic lesion into a resectable one. Since more than 12 months have passed since FOLFOX treatment, the same scheme could be used, although FOLFIRI+bevacizumab would also be useful. Capecitabine monotherapy, in the patient's current situation, would also not be a good starting option, since the responses are lower compared to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI plus antiangiogenic combinations. Hepatic radiotherapy could be considered, as SBRT techniques show very good results; however, it is advisable to first seek a surgical assessment.

Laboratory tests show a bilirubin level of 12 mg/dl (with 9.5 direct bilirubin). Abdominal ultrasound shows dilatation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tract, together with a single 2 cm nodule located peripherally in the anterior aspect of the left lobe. CT scan confirms the findings, also demonstrating the presence of a 3.5 cm mass in the head of the pancreas. Fine needle aspiration confirms the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Indicate the best therapeutic option:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nMetallic biliary prosthesis by endoscopic retrograde cholangiography, with the option of palliative chemotherapy is the best therapeutic option. Although both lesions are resectable, pancreatic adenocarcinoma with synchronous hepatic metastases has no surgical indication because it does not prolong survival and has a high morbidity. Surgical bypass has more complications than placing a self-expanding metallic prosthesis that has a median patency of 6 months which is similar to the median survival of a patient with hepatic metastases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma.\n\n",

In view of the diagnostic suspicion, the following conduct is to be followed:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nLet's see: a patient with certain history who has: - Schistocytes in smear: indicates microangiopathic anemia, red cell rupture of mechanical cause, which can be seen mainly in PTT, autoimmune hemolytic anemia and DIC. - Bicytopenia: here the causes can be very, very varied. - Elevation of LDH and Bilirubin, which indicates a massive rupture of red blood cells. - Negative direct Coombs' test: essential data, indicating that there is no antibody that sticks to the red blood cells. Hemorrhagic transformation does not give a brutal elevation of LDH and Cr, and it doesn't explain schistocytosis. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is produced by rupture of red blood cells when they are fragmented by ultralong von Willebrand factor multimers in case of deficiency of the ADAMST13 enzyme, resulting in brutal platelet aggregates and the flow cytometer does not count 400 platelets, but a molondron of platelets that form a mass, hence the thrombocytopenia.

In those cases we should pay attention to the shape of the dendrite (the true dendrite is deeper and has terminal bulbs at the end of each branch), and pay attention to the evolution of the pain (in the pseudodendrite after abrasion the pain should improve). Fungal and bacterial keratitis have corneal infiltrates. And glaucomatocyclitic crisis (Posner Schlossman syndrome) is a type of idiopathic hypertensive anterior uveitis, which does not present with ulceration.\n\n",

This scan showed the presence of 4 liver lesions (one of them up to 6 cm) with uptake pattern typical of hepatocarcinoma, tumor vascular invasion and a metastasis in the right adrenal gland. No ascites is observed. The patient reports only asthenia, but no general syndrome. The treatment of this patient would be:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe patient presents a good general condition with a recently diagnosed hepatocarcinoma, not giving him any type of treatment other than symptomatic and supportive at this stage would not be the right thing to do. TACE would not be indicated because of extrahepatic involvement. Transplantation would also not be done if he has extrahepatic disease. A systemic treatment is indicated because it is metastatic of which oral sorafenib would be the more appropriate treatment regarding patient's clinical case.\n\n",
