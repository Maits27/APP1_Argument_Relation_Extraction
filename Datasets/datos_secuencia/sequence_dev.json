Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis.

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

        "premise": "QUESTION TYPE: UROLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 45-year-old male patient with a history of uric lithiasis with repeated expulsive nephritic colic for 25 years, comes to the ED referring palpitations and intense right lumbar pain since 2 hours before. Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

        "premise": "QUESTION TYPE: UROLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 45-year-old male patient with a history of uric lithiasis with repeated expulsive nephritic colic for 25 years, comes to the ED referring palpitations and intense right lumbar pain since 2 hours before. Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent.

This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm.

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n\n",

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation.

What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops.

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other.

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis.

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis.

Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. This situation depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. Looking at the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis.

It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm.

It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis.

It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis.

It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other.

It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. The diagnosis would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase, in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other.

On examination, the patient is tachypneic at 36 rpm, with supraclavicular pull, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 81%, cyanosis, sweating, tachycardia at 135 beats per minute and BP of 75/47 mm Hg.

HIV serology is positive and shows an ADC lymphocyte count of 176 cells/ml. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nPatient with risk factor for HIV acquisition, who comes to the emergency department for a subacute onset of 2 weeks of evolution (fever, malaise and dry cough) that worsens abruptly (pleuritic pain) and progressively (dyspnea). Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur). He has a positive HIV serology and a CD4 less than 200 cells/mL. The radiograph shows hyperclarity in the left lung field with absence of vessels between the lung border and the chest wall on the left side, displacement of the mediastinum and trachea to the right side, and a stump in the left pulmonary hilum corresponding to the collapsed lung. The suspicion of HIV is high and although it is pending confirmation, in the emergency it is valid to assume this option. That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture, the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms (you have to look for something that explains everything or almost everything), pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image, Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax, but here in a patient with a respiratory picture with more than 7 days of evolution that is complicated abruptly, in a patient with a high suspicion of HIV infection may have pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia. In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas). Patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia have, in 90% of cases, a CD4 count < 250 cells/mL. Other agents that can cause pulmonary involvement less frequently are Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma and Leishmania. Although the frequency of the different opportunistic infections has varied as a consequence of the administration of highly effective antiretroviral treatments, our patient would be in a setting where he has not yet received HAART.\n\n",

In the previous 2 weeks he had presented febrile fever, general malaise and dry cough. On examination, the patient is tachypneic at 36 rpm, with supraclavicular pull, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 81%, cyanosis, sweating, tachycardia at 135 beats per minute and BP of 75/47 mm Hg.

What is the most likely diagnosis?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nPatient with risk factor for HIV acquisition, who comes to the emergency department for a subacute onset of 2 weeks of evolution (fever, malaise and dry cough) that worsens abruptly (pleuritic pain) and progressively (dyspnea). Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur). He has a positive HIV serology and a CD4 less than 200 cells/mL. The radiograph shows hyperclarity in the left lung field with absence of vessels between the lung border and the chest wall on the left side, displacement of the mediastinum and trachea to the right side, and a stump in the left pulmonary hilum corresponding to the collapsed lung.

That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture, the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms (you have to look for something that explains everything or almost everything), pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image, Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax, but here in a patient with a respiratory picture with more than 7 days of evolution that is complicated abruptly, in a patient with a high suspicion of HIV infection may have pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia. In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas). Patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia have, in 90% of cases, a CD4 count < 250 cells/mL. Other agents that can cause pulmonary involvement less frequently are Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma and Leishmania.

He has a positive HIV serology and a CD4 less than 200 cells/mL. The radiograph shows hyperclarity in the left lung field with absence of vessels between the lung border and the chest wall on the left side, displacement of the mediastinum and trachea to the right side, and a stump in the left pulmonary hilum corresponding to the collapsed lung. The suspicion of HIV is high and although it is pending confirmation, in the emergency it is valid to assume this option. That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture, the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms (you have to look for something that explains everything or almost everything), pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image, Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax, but here in a patient with a respiratory picture with more than 7 days of evolution that is complicated abruptly, in a patient with a high suspicion of HIV infection may have pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia. In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas). Patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia have, in 90% of cases, a CD4 count < 250 cells/mL. Other agents that can cause pulmonary involvement less frequently are Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma and Leishmania. Although the frequency of the different opportunistic infections has varied as a consequence of the administration of highly effective antiretroviral treatments, our patient would be in a setting where he has not yet received HAART.\n\n",

On examination, the patient is tachypneic at 36 rpm, with supraclavicular pull, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 81%, cyanosis, sweating, tachycardia at 135 beats per minute and BP of 75/47 mm Hg.

What is the most likely diagnosis?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nPatient with risk factor for HIV acquisition, who comes to the emergency department for a subacute onset of 2 weeks of evolution (fever, malaise and dry cough) that worsens abruptly (pleuritic pain) and progressively (dyspnea). Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur). He has a positive HIV serology and a CD4 less than 200 cells/mL. The radiograph shows hyperclarity in the left lung field with absence of vessels between the lung border and the chest wall on the left side, displacement of the mediastinum and trachea to the right side, and a stump in the left pulmonary hilum corresponding to the collapsed lung. The suspicion of HIV is high and although it is pending confirmation, in the emergency it is valid to assume this option. That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture, the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms (you have to look for something that explains everything or almost everything), pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image, Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax, but here in a patient with a respiratory picture with more than 7 days of evolution that is complicated abruptly, in a patient with a high suspicion of HIV infection may have pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia. In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas). Patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia have, in 90% of cases, a CD4 count < 250 cells/mL. Other agents that can cause pulmonary involvement less frequently are Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma and Leishmania. Although the frequency of the different opportunistic infections has varied as a consequence of the administration of highly effective antiretroviral treatments, our patient would be in a setting where he has not yet received HAART.\n\n",

Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur).

In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas).

Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur). He has a positive HIV serology and a CD4 less than 200 cells/mL. The radiograph shows hyperclarity in the left lung field with absence of vessels between the lung border and the chest wall on the left side, displacement of the mediastinum and trachea to the right side, and a stump in the left pulmonary hilum corresponding to the collapsed lung. The suspicion of HIV is high and although it is pending confirmation, in the emergency it is valid to assume this option. That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture, the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms (you have to look for something that explains everything or almost everything), pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image, Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax, but here in a patient with a respiratory picture with more than 7 days of evolution that is complicated abruptly, in a patient with a high suspicion of HIV infection may have pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia. In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas).

Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur).

In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas).

In the previous 2 weeks he had presented febrile fever, general malaise and dry cough. On examination, the patient is tachypneic at 36 rpm, with supraclavicular pull, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 81%, cyanosis, sweating, tachycardia at 135 beats per minute and BP of 75/47 mm Hg.

Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur). He has a positive HIV serology and a CD4 less than 200 cells/mL. The radiograph shows hyperclarity in the left lung field with absence of vessels between the lung border and the chest wall on the left side, displacement of the mediastinum and trachea to the right side, and a stump in the left pulmonary hilum corresponding to the collapsed lung.

That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture, the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms (you have to look for something that explains everything or almost everything), pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image, Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax, but here in a patient with a respiratory picture with more than 7 days of evolution that is complicated abruptly, in a patient with a high suspicion of HIV infection may have pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia. In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas).

Mycobacterium marinum is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium characterized by being environmental, opportunistic and photochromogenic. It has a slow growth, from 2 to 8 weeks, at a temperature ranging from 30 to 37 °C. It affects different species of fish in cold, warm, fresh or salt water, especially stagnant waters of fish tanks and pools without chlorine. Infection in humans occurs by direct contact with fish or contaminated water in the presence of a loss of continuity in the skin of the host. Our patient has no history of exposure to fish or water (they don't say), so considering that usually the diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion and specifically asking for this history, our case is far from this possibility. The Sporothrix schenckii complex is the causative agent of Sporotrichosis, this dimorphic fungus is located in the soil, the complex is formed by 5 species, S. schenckii sensu strictu, S. brasiliensis and S. globosa, capable of causing human and animal disease; the other two are S. mexicana and S. albicana not associated with any disease.

Of the microorganisms discussed, Microsporum gypseum does not usually manifest dissemination of infection of a lymphangitic aspect, in general keratinophilic fungi (dermatophytes) do not have any ability to invade deep tissues. Staphylococcus aureus infection can affect superficial and deep tissue layers, they can spread following a lymphangitic path, but it is not usual such a long evolution, it is usually acute and usually accompanied by systemic symptoms. Mycobacterium marinum is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium characterized by being environmental, opportunistic and photochromogenic. It has a slow growth, from 2 to 8 weeks, at a temperature ranging from 30 to 37 °C.

It affects different species of fish in cold, warm, fresh or salt water, especially stagnant waters of fish tanks and pools without chlorine. Infection in humans occurs by direct contact with fish or contaminated water in the presence of a loss of continuity in the skin of the host. Our patient has no history of exposure to fish or water (they don't say), so considering that usually the diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion and specifically asking for this history, our case is far from this possibility. The Sporothrix schenckii complex is the causative agent of Sporotrichosis, this dimorphic fungus is located in the soil, the complex is formed by 5 species, S. schenckii sensu strictu, S. brasiliensis and S. globosa, capable of causing human and animal disease; the other two are S. mexicana and S. albicana not associated with any disease. Patients are usually infected by exposure to soil by means of a sharp object (thorns, stems, animal claws, etc.) and have a slow evolution, affect deep tissues and their dissemination typically follows a pathway as described in the question.\n\n",
