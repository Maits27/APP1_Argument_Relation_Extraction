Her father (not diagnosed with NF1) died in a traffic accident at the age of 38 years. On examination, the mother presents two café-au-lait spots and attends the genetic counseling consultation with her new partner where a preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is proposed. Is PGD indicated in this case?\n3- It is not indicated because NF1 responds to mutations in the neurofibromin gene (17q11.2), with recessive inheritance.\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nThe first step is to detect the mutation and once detected, if the mother is a carrier, to proceed with PGD.\n",

Laboratory tests showed anemia of 8 g/dL, thrombopenia of 4000/microliter and leukopenia of 1200/microliter with absolute neutropenia. The coagulation study showed APTT elongation (43″), decreased prothrombin activity (55%), hypofibrinogenemia (98 mg/dl) and presence of high concentration of D-Dimer and fibrin monomers. She is referred for urgent hematologic workup and a bone marrow aspirate is performed showing massive infiltration by immature elements with cleaved nuclei and Auer rods in the cytoplasm. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nAfter reading such a long statement, running out of breath, going over it and getting overwhelmed, it is time to take a look at it and grasp at something very characteristic. A woman with pancytopenia. A bone marrow showing massive infiltration by immature elements that are proliferating non-stop...with Auer's canes? Acute promyelocytic leukemia. Those rods are the fusion of primary granules of developing myelocytes. Robin&Cotran say so on page 696 of their book \"General Pathology\" [1]. It is also said by Carr and Rodak in their book \"Atlas of clinical hematology\" on page 157 [2].\n",

He reports a fever of up to 39.5ºC of 5 days evolution that does not subside despite treatment with amoxicillin prescribed 72 hours ago for suspected acute pharyngotonsillitis. During the last 24 hours he has had erythematous and pruritic exanthema of cephalocaudal evolution and during the last few days his parents have noticed a cough and intense conjunctivitis. No rhinorrhea was reported. Clinical examination showed subcrepitant in both lung bases without tachypnea or signs of respiratory distress. On oropharyngeal examination there are whitish spots in the jugal mucosa. What is the most probable diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nThe correct answer is 5. The clue is in the whitish lesions of the jugal mucosa corresponding to Koplik's spots, which are pathognomonic of measles, although as an observation I would say that they usually appear in the prodromal phase of the disease and are often no longer seen when the exanthema appears. In this case you are describing measles complicated by pneumonia. Very timely question at the present time.\n",

        "context": "QUESTION TYPE: UROLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 45-year-old male patient with a history of uric lithiasis with repeated expulsive nephritic colic for 25 years, comes to the ED referring palpitations and intense right lumbar pain since 2 hours before. Urinalysis showed a pH of 5.5 and leukocyturia without proteinuria. The ECG confirms a previously unknown atrial fibrillation. Blood biochemistry shows a creatinine of 0.9mg/dl, a calcium of 11mg/dl and an LDH of 950 U/l. What is the most useful diagnostic maneuver to perform?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nIn this question I have more doubts as to which is the correct answer, since we must interpret which is the most useful test, with which we can obtain more performance. However, this situation also depends on the radiology services of each center and their preferences. I will focus on the urological part, leaving aside the rest of the symptomatology. - Abdominal X-ray is the first imaging study to be performed because it is fast, simple and practically innocuous (except in children and pregnant women). 90% of the stones are radiopaque and therefore visible, but the sensitivity of this test, used in isolation, decreases to 45-59%. It is a mandatory test in any suspicion of colic pain. However, it has a lower yield than the others. Although the urological history speaks of uric lithiasis (radiotransparent), with an acid pH that reaffirms the diagnosis of uric origin, we can never rule out calcium oxalate lithiasis that can appear synchronously. - IVUS seems to me to be one of the best performing options. It will give us diagnostic clarity of obstruction, its magnitude and its renal repercussions. It has long been considered the examination of choice for the study of patients with renal lithiasis. It is a test with high sensitivity and specificity (87-90% and 94-100%, respectively), relatively innocuous, and available in all hospitals. It informs us of the number, size, shape and location of the stone, as well as the functional status of the affected kidney. - Contrast-enhanced CT seems to me to be the most efficient option. It serves to discover lithiasis that other tests cannot find and gives us a global image of the rest of the structures. Great performance but also more expensive, more time, more radiation. It has been confirmed as a high sensitivity and specificity scan, surpassing previous tests (94-100% and 92-100%, respectively, for the detection of ureteral calculi) and with its numerous advantages it has become the reference test and is expected to replace IVUS and ultrasound worldwide. It performs a helical scan with 5 mm slices allowing the detection of stones up to 2 mm. With the administration of contrast, it allows the evaluation of renal function. - Ultrasound is a fast, cheap and innocuous test, but very radiologist-dependent. It gives great renal information on obstructive repercussions, but less quality in terms of finding a lithiasis. Ultrasonography only detects calculi larger than 4 mm, located in the pyelo-ureteral junction or the uretero-vesical junction, while the lumbar and pelvic ureter is not very accessible due to the interposition of the intestinal loops. Therefore, ultrasound performed in isolation is not very sensitive (20-45%) for the detection of calculi, but associated with simple abdominal radiography increases its sensitivity and specificity. - Doppler echocardiography has no use in urological diagnosis. My answer would be CT with ev contrast and excretory phase (answer (c)), in terms of performance, sensitivity and specificity. There are radiology services more skilled or predisposed to one or the other. Without forgetting that abdominal X-ray should always be done in the suspicion of colic.\n",

On examination, in addition to localization and slight malar hypertrichosis.  The most likely diagnosis is:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nPorphyria Cutanea Tarda: 60% of patients with PCT are male, many of them drink alcohol in excess, women who develop it are usually treated with drugs containing estrogens. Most are males with signs of iron overload, this overload reduces the activity of the enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, which leads to the elevation of uroporphyrins. HCV and HIV infections have been implicated in the precipitation of acquired PCT. There is a hereditary form with AD pattern. Patients with PCT present with blistering of photoexposed skin, most frequently on the dorsum of the hands and scalp. In addition to fragility, they may develop hypertrichosis, hyperpigmentation, cicatricial alopecia and sclerodermal induration.\n",

Our objective will be, first of all, to \"relax\" the myocardium: for this purpose, a beta-blocker is recommended, whereas digoxin, as a good positive inotrope, increases the gradient and is contraindicated.

Radiographs of the femur show radiolucent bands perpendicular to the cortex on the inner side of the upper femur. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nAlthough this one had not been assigned to me, I am answering it as well since it deals with an endocrinology topic: vitamin D. In this case there are important data such as the history of intestinal resection, hypocalcemia and hypophosphoremoia; this should lead us to think in a vitamin D deficit due to malabsorption and therefore, in an osteomalacia.

Examination is normal, except for the presence of bilateral papilledema. Which of these tests do you think will allow you to fully confirm the diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nAgain we are presented with a case to make a diagnosis and then, in this case, perform a confirmatory test. Now the guiding symptom is bilateral papilledema which is indicative of intracranial hypertension. Although he does not comment that a space-occupying lesion has been ruled out, given the normal neurological examination and the other symptoms, it is deduced that it is idiopathic intracranial hypertension or pseudotumor cerebri. Other data suggestive of this entity include: women of reproductive age, obesity, and diplopia (due to involvement of the VI cranial nerve). It is characteristic that the headache and visual blurriness suddenly worsen in the mornings when getting up or changing posture, producing transitory blindness (Neurology, Zarranz).

He denies drug intake and abdominal pain. Laboratory tests show normal ALT, AST, GGT and FA, with total bilirubin of 3.2 mg/dl and direct bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dl. She has no anemia and the liver is ultrasonographically normal. What is her diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nAn increase in indirect bilirubin less than 5 (intermittently, under stress) in a young healthy boy should make us think of Gilbert's syndrome. In Rotor syndrome, Dubin-Johnson syndrome and choledocholithiasis there is an increase in direct bilirubin. In the case of acute hepatitis there should be an elevation of transaminases.\n",

Which of the following procedures would you consider performing first to rule out the coexistence of other diseases that may justify the findings described?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nThe approach is questionable due to lack of sufficient data. The correct answer could be respiratory polygraphy, especially in the case of an obese patient, which we do not know, but it could also be correct 2 (echocardiogram) in the case of suspicion of associated cardiopathy, less frequent but also possible. The association of COPD with OSAHS is a frequent cause of COPD deterioration, greater than that which would correspond to functional impairment.\n",

In the previous 2 weeks he had presented febrile fever, general malaise and dry cough. On examination, the patient is tachypneic at 36 rpm, with supraclavicular pull, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry of 81%, cyanosis, sweating, tachycardia at 135 beats per minute and BP of 75/47 mm Hg. The trachea is deviated to the right side and auscultation shows complete absence of vesicular murmur in the left hemithorax. HIV serology is positive and shows an ADC lymphocyte count of 176 cells/ml. What is the most likely diagnosis?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nPatient with risk factor for HIV acquisition, who comes to the emergency department for a subacute onset of 2 weeks of evolution (fever, malaise and dry cough) that worsens abruptly (pleuritic pain) and progressively (dyspnea). Physical examination suggests a pneumothorax (tachypnea, tugging, low saturation, cyanosis, diaphoresis, tachycardia, deviated trachea and absence of vesicular murmur). He has a positive HIV serology and a CD4 less than 200 cells/mL. The radiograph shows hyperclarity in the left lung field with absence of vessels between the lung border and the chest wall on the left side, displacement of the mediastinum and trachea to the right side, and a stump in the left pulmonary hilum corresponding to the collapsed lung. The suspicion of HIV is high and although it is pending confirmation, in the emergency it is valid to assume this option. That said, I am looking for pathologies that are associated with this picture, the rupture of a bulla although it is related to the appearance of abrupt symptoms does not go hand in hand with the other symptoms (you have to look for something that explains everything or almost everything), pneumonia although it is true that it can be related to many of the symptoms does not correlate with the image, Pulmonary TB could be manifested with all of the above and cause a pneumothorax, but here in a patient with a respiratory picture with more than 7 days of evolution that is complicated abruptly, in a patient with a high suspicion of HIV infection the clearest option goes for pneumonia due to P. jirovecii pneumonia. In patients with Pneumocystis, 10%, pneumatoceles appear which can sometimes open into the pleural space producing a spontaneous pneumothorax. As a reminder, the most frequent germs in pulmonary involvement in patients with HIV/AIDS infection are P. jiroveci (alone or associated with tuberculosis or other mycobacteria), S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. aureus, cytomegalovirus, Legionella, staphylococci and gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas). Patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia have, in 90% of cases, a CD4 count < 250 cells/mL. Other agents that can cause pulmonary involvement less frequently are Rhodococcus equi, Nocardia, Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Toxoplasma and Leishmania. Although the frequency of the different opportunistic infections has varied as a consequence of the administration of highly effective antiretroviral treatments, our patient would be in a setting where he has not yet received HAART.\n",

        "context": "QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 58-year-old man reported a weeks-long history of progressive, mildly painful skin lesions on his left arm. It had started as an erythematous lesion on his left thumb. He had visible reddish striae as connecting lines between the lesions. The patient had no fever or other general symptoms. He had been working in his garden but did not remember any injuries. The etiologic diagnosis was made by culture of a skin biopsy. What is the most likely causative agent of this process?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThe patient carries out an activity in contact with soil and plants (which are not provided free of charge). The symptoms are chronic, which started distally (left thumb) and are affecting the ipsilateral arm (reddish striae). There were no systemic symptoms. They also comment that the diagnosis was made on the basis of a skin biopsy. Of the microorganisms discussed, Microsporum gypseum does not usually manifest dissemination of infection of a lymphangitic aspect, in general keratinophilic fungi (dermatophytes) do not have any ability to invade deep tissues, so we ruled out this option. Staphylococcus aureus infection can affect superficial and deep tissue layers, they can spread following a lymphangitic path, but it is not usual such a long evolution, it is usually acute (days) and usually accompanied by systemic symptoms, so we discard this option. Mycobacterium marinum (and not Mycobacterum marinum) is a non-tuberculous mycobacterium characterized by being environmental, opportunistic and photochromogenic. It has a slow growth, from 2 to 8 weeks, at a temperature ranging from 30 to 37 °C. It affects different species of fish in cold, warm, fresh or salt water, especially stagnant waters of fish tanks and pools without chlorine. Infection in humans occurs by direct contact with fish or contaminated water in the presence of a loss of continuity in the skin of the host. Our patient has no history of exposure to fish or water (they don't say), so considering that usually the diagnosis is based on a high index of suspicion and specifically asking for this history, our case is far from this possibility. The Sporothrix schenckii complex is the causative agent of Sporotrichosis, this dimorphic fungus is located in the soil, the complex is formed by 5 species, S. schenckii sensu strictu, S. brasiliensis and S. globosa, capable of causing human and animal disease; the other two are S. mexicana and S. albicana not associated with any disease. Patients are usually infected by exposure to soil by means of a sharp object (thorns, stems, animal claws, etc.) and have a slow evolution, affect deep tissues and their dissemination typically follows a pathway as described in the question.\n",

After the pertinent studies, it was decided to operate on the patient, performing a total thyroidectomy with emptying of the central lymph node component. The pathologist's report was that the 2.3 cm thyroid nodule was entirely occupied by a papillary thyroid carcinoma, tall cell variant, without vascular infiltration but with capsular infiltration. Thyroglobulin concentrations 24 h after thyroidectomy are 14 ng/mL. What would be the next step you would take in this patient?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe verification of the presence of thyroglobulin in blood and the development of techniques by which it can be determined have provided a new procedure for monitoring patients with papillary or follicular thyroid carcinoma. Thyroglobulin is synthesized in the follicular cells and then secreted into the circulation, therefore, after total thyroidectomy it should disappear, if this does not occur we must think about the existence of remnants of metastatic tissue.\n",

He tells the ER doctor \"I feel fine, I was walking and I got lost\". The examination, by systems, is anodyne. When asked about his medication, he does not remember. His history includes glipizide, atenolol and acenocoumarol. She has been to the ER 3 times in the last three months for \"dizziness\", low back pain and an INR of 5. She reports independence in basic and instrumental activities of daily living. There is no evidence of family or close friends. Several references from the social work in the area indicate that she refuses medical or nursing aids or visits. In the physical examination, only temperature of 37.7, BMI of 16, BP of 160/90, HR of 90 and SO2 of 99% stand out. He has global loss of muscle mass. He is dressed in his robe and smells of urine. He refuses to answer Minimental's questions. Laboratory tests include 13,000 leukocytes, blood glucose 300, glycosylated hemoglobin 11%, INR 0.9, urine over 50 leukocytes/field, nitrites+ and urine culture > 100,000 Gram negative bacilli. He is admitted to the hospital, receives antibiotics, insulin and restarts acenocoumarol with good evolution. He is stable and wants to go home. The ward nurse says he is unable to self-administer insulin. Which of the following is the next step in determining the patient's safety at home?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nAssessing capacity is not about taking away the patient's autonomy, but making sure that the patient understands and is aware of the consequences of his decisions. In fact, it is a protective measure for the most fragile patients to ensure the best care. This is not done by a psychiatrist, but by the attending physician. There are several tests or semi-structured interviews to assess the capacity of patients, and all physicians should be familiar with these instruments. It is important that it is the attending physician who performs this assessment, because he/she is the one who previously informs the patient (informed consent) of the therapeutic plan and is the one who is best able to assess whether the patient has understood everything: what the medical problem is, what treatment is proposed, the alternatives if any, whether to accept or reject any of them and why, the consequences of making these decisions (also those of not wanting treatment), even assessing psychopathology susceptible to an ICP to Psychiatry.\n",

        "context": "QUESTION TYPE: INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND MICROBIOLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nLuis is a 25-year-old young man who underwent splenectomy after a bicycle accident 1 year ago. He has a dog that bit him 24 hours ago and has caused a small wound on his right hand. She comes to her health center (located 3 hours from the nearest hospital) with fever of 39°C, pain in the wound and general malaise. On examination, BP 100/60 mm Hg, HR 110 beats per minute, slight swelling in the wound without pus. Which of the following actions is most indicated at this time?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThis question has been complicated for us. The question does not have all the necessary information, but using what we have we can try to answer. The dog is domestic, known and can be monitored, so we would have to wait for the observation period to pass and prophylaxis is not recommended. At this point we will only have to worry about the possible bacteremia that may be occurring in a patient with the possibility of high risk due to asplenia. The treatment of choice in dog bite is amoxicillin/clavulanic acid but it is not available, so we can use another treatment such as clindamycin plus cephalosporin or clindamycin + moxifloxacin but it is not contemplated among the alternatives. In a first attempt we answered 4, but the correct answer is 3, because of the second part of the question; it is a high risk patient with incipient signs of sepsis so he should be sent to the hospital, here the key more than the antibiotic is in the position to take, in the second part of each answer. It could be challenged since they do not say in which community the bite occurred (if it was in Ceuta or Melilla the protocol may vary).\n",

He has an ocular pressure of 34 mmHg in his right eye and 31 mmHg in his left eye. Which of the following pharmacological groups is the most indicated as first choice as hypotensive treatment?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nWe are asked about the first choice treatment for glaucoma. In the past, beta-blockers were the first choice, but nowadays they have been displaced by the group that lowers intraocular pressure the most: prostaglandins. Their efficacy and more convenient dosage (once a day) generally make them the group of choice. Beta-blockers would remain as a second choice in cases in which the side effects of prostaglandins (change in eye color, increase in eyelash size) make us initially leave them aside. Since the patient is asthmatic, we should rule out beta-blockers (wrong answer 2). Also, since we need a significant drop in intraocular pressure because the numbers are high (34 and 31), we can also rule out carbonic anhydrase inhibitors and alpha-2 agonists (options 1 and 3 incorrect). And opt for the group that can lower intraocular pressure the most. Answer 4 correct. And then a couple of nuances of the statement. It would be more correct to talk about intraocular pressure and not \"ocular pressure\". And the wording could be improved so as not to repeat the word \"as\" in the last sentence.\n",

She has mild thigh pain and leg failure on support. On examination she has weakness in hip flexion and knee extension, and dysesthesias in the anterior aspect of the thigh. What is the most probable diagnosis of suspicion:\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nThe femoral nerve (although rare) may be damaged in a cesarean section, hysterectomy or lower abdominal operation. This nerve injury produces hypoesthesia and weakness along its distribution. Femoroneuropathy is manifested by paralysis (25% of cases) of the quadriceps muscles, abolition of patellar reflexes and hypoesthesia of the anterior and inner thigh. Therefore, answer 1 is correct. The femoral cutaneous or lateral femoral cutaneous nerve (L2,L3) is only sensitive and is responsible for the sensitivity of the skin of the lateral and anterior aspect of the thigh up to the knee, so it would not explain the motor problem of gait and 2 is false. The obturator nerve (L2-L4) is a mixed nerve. At the motor level, it invests the obturator externus, pectineus, short approximator, the approximators (adductors) and gracilis. At the sensory level the capsule of the coxofemoral joint, medial aspect of the thigh above the knee. Therefore neither affects the sensitivity of the anterior aspect of the thigh nor the extension of the knee so that 3 is false. A lesion of the sciatic nerve at motor level affects to the flexion of the knee not to its extension and at distal level to this one (they do not count anything of distal clinic) and at sensitive level also it is distal in the external face of the leg and in the foot reason why 4 also is false.\n",

She consults because her mother was operated on for a thyroid tumor and a grandmother died 10 years ago from a pheochromocytoma. The priority therapeutic attitude we will adopt will be:\n2- Biochemical analysis with calcitonin. If it is normal, no further control is necessary at this age.\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe correct answer is 4. It seems to me to be more of an endocrine question than a pediatric question. Proto-oncogene carriers usually have early thyroid tumors so radical thyroidectomy is usually recommended before the age of 5 years. Obviously I had to look this up...it is not very common in our routine practice.\n",

He reports presenting with anxious symptoms and depressive mood for the last 10 months. This condition moderately interferes with her daily activities. She has no previous psychiatric history. This situation is the result of the death, in a car accident, of an older brother with whom he was very close. Indicate which of the following diagnoses is appropriate:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThe relative mildness of the symptoms, which do not seriously interfere with daily activities, excludes in principle the diagnosis of major depression. There is no evidence of hypomanic phases to justify a bipolar II disorder. Dysthymia requires a duration of at least two years. Cyclothymia is a very rare diagnosis nowadays (because, as Castilla del Pino said in an interview, what used to be cyclothymics are now called bipolar, contributing to one of the multiple psychiatric epidemics of our time), which consists of oscillations between the depressive pole and the manifest, mild. But there are no data on such oscillations. The correct answer is, in all probability, 3. The adaptive disorder appears within 3 months after the stressful event and does not last more than 6 months if the stressful event or its consequences have ceased (which is not the case because the brother of the imaginary patient is still dead). Mild anxious-depressive symptoms fit such a diagnosis. One more example of how to conceptualize as illness what are facts (albeit painful) of life. Surely the imaginary patient takes some antidepressant because maybe something helps (1).\n",

There is no evidence of edema and blood pressure is 130/70. The blood test shows Na 126 mEq/l and K 4 mEq/l, natriuria is 45 mEq/l and diuretic intake has been ruled out. Which of the following is the most correct approach?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe are presented with a patient with moderate euvolemic hyponatremia, suggesting a syndrome of inadequate antidiuresis (SIAD) secondary to sertraline, although it would be necessary to have urinary osmolality to confirm this. Primary adrenal insufficiency produces hypovolemic hyponatremia (incorrect option 1). Diabetes insipidus is the opposite of this pathology, usually presenting with hypernatremia (option 4 incorrect). The question remains whether to treat aggressively with hypertonic saline, or to be more conservative by indicating hydric restriction. With natremia above 125 mmol/l it is not indicated to treat with HSS unless the patient has severe neurological symptoms, which does not seem to be the case (they describe a confusional picture that would be a moderate hyponatremic encephalopathy), and it is not indicated to restore natremia as soon as possible (due to the risk of osmotic demyelination syndrome). Therefore, the correct answer would be 3. What I do not like about this answer is that the second part (\"if natraemia does not rise, switch to slow infusion of saline\") is incorrect, since in this case the use of furosemide, tolvaptan or urea should be considered, not saline (and it does not indicate tonicity either, since isotonic is not the same as hypertonic).

For this, the best option would be to request reticulocytes, however, as it is not among the options, we should request a Coombs' test, so the correct answer is 2. Although they want to confuse us with a MCV 108, so that we think of a megaloblastic anemia, the MCV is not excessively high, the onset of anemia in our patient has been rapid and would not fit with SLE or the form of presentation.

        "context": "QUESTION TYPE: TRAUMATOLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 41-year-old male consults for gonalgia of several days' evolution. During the examination, the Thessaly test is performed (pain with internal and external rotation movements with the knee flexed), which is positive. Which of the following lesions is more probable?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nAnswer 1 correct: The Thessaly test is a meniscal exploration maneuver. The statement focuses exclusively on this part of the examination and also explains that it is indeed positive, which leads to the suspicion of a meniscal lesion. \"The Thessaly test is a dynamic reproduction of load transmission in the knee joint and is performed at 5° and 20° of flexion. The examiner supports the patient by holding his or her outstretched hands while the patient stands flatfooted on the floor. The patient then rotates his or her knee and body, internally and externally, three times, keeping the knee in slight flexion (5°). Then the same procedure is carried out with the knee flexed at 20°. Patients with suspected meniscal tears experience medial or lateral joint-line discomfort and may have a sense of locking or catching. The theory behind the test is that, with this maneuver, the knee with a meniscal tear is subjected to excessive loading conditions and almost certainly will have the same symptoms that the patient reported. The test is always performed first on the normal knee so that the patient may be trained, especially with regard to how to keep the knee in 5° and then in 20° of flexion and how to recognize, by comparison, a possible positive result in the symptomatic knee.\" Answer 2 incorrect: At no time do they describe any exploration maneuvers of the anterior cruciate ligament, nor do they mention any trauma that may have injured it. Answer 3 incorrect: At no time do they describe any exploration maneuvers of the posterior cruciate ligament, nor do they mention any trauma that could have injured it. Wrong answer 4: Although it could occur, it is not to be expected in a 41 year old person with an acutely established clinical condition.\n",

As a general rule we could say that below 50º the treatment is usually conservative, with two options: observation or use of a brace to slow down the evolution. In this case, taking into account the remaining growth (menarche 3 months ago and Risser 0) the most indicated would be to use a brace (Answer 2 correct).\n",

Rotation of the MMII on the stretcher grasped by the ankles is painless and compression of the pelvis is asymptomatic. Next:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nFrom the symptoms reported, tingling in the anterior thigh, scrotum and dysesthesia in the feet, there seems to be a vertebral involvement at L2-3 and sacral roots, so the correct thing to do would be to perform a radiological examination without mobilizing the patient.

        "context": "QUESTION TYPE: PATHOLOGICAL ANATOMY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 56-year-old man, diabetic and moderately overweight, presents a discrete hepatomegaly. The patient indicates that he is not a regular drinker, only exceptionally does he drink some wine. A liver biopsy shows accumulations of clear cytoplasmic vacuoles in 50% of the hepatocytes. Multiple inflammatory foci with neutrophils, Mallory's hyaline degeneration and fibrosis around the terminal hepatic venules. Point out the correct answer in this case:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nThe changes described in the question statement correspond to an early precirrhotic situation. Although alcohol is the most frequent toxicant that causes this condition, it is not the exclusive cause. Diabetes mellitus causes similar hepatic alterations: fat accumulation in hepatocytes, centroacinar fibrosis, inflammatory infiltrate by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and hyaline degeneration of perinuclear mallory. Taking this into consideration, we can rule out the second question (they are intracellular fat accumulations, not glycogen) and the fourth (if diabetes also produces this situation, there is no reason to mistrust the patient). Based on the primum non nocere and not having special relevance for the treatment if it is a focal or generalized disease, it is not necessary to repeat a liver biopsy that would not expand information, discarding the first question. Fortunately for the hypothetical patient, in the initial phase these changes are reversible when the noxa disappears, so we are left with answer number 5.\n",

Blood gas analysis performed while breathing room air shows pH 7.45, paO2 56, PaCO2 30 mm Hg, HCO3 26 mm Hg. What gasometric alteration does the patient present?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nI found this question tricky. The separate findings are: normal pH but with alkalosis tendency, acute respiratory failure, hypocapnia and normal bicarbonate. The most appropriate answer seems to me to be 1, since the patient does not present a metabolic alkalosis (bicarbonate would be higher), much less an acidosis (bicarbonate would be low). The alkalosis is not mixed either, but is mainly respiratory. The patient is probably hyperventilating because of her respiratory failure, and the kidney which always compensates later is starting to retain HCO3 to compensate and maintain pH. Therefore I believe the correct answer is 1.\n",

She comes to the emergency room because for 3 days she presents fever of 38ºC, polyuria, dysuria, intense thirst and progressive decrease in the level of consciousness. Physical examination showed signs of dehydration, BP 95/54 mm Hg and no signs of neurological localization. The CBC shows leukocytosis, creatinine of 1.8 mg/dL and blood glucose of 855 mg/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nThe question relates the case of a type 2 diabetic patient with hyperglycemia and decreased level of consciousness without neurological focality in the context of a urinary tract infection and who has developed acute renal failure of probable prerenal origin. Option 2 is immediately ruled out because the clinical picture is not one of heart failure. Option 3 is also discarded because it does not fit with the clinical picture and in addition HSD would give neurological symptoms with locality. Option 4 is discarded because obstructive renal failure does not give polyuria, dysuria or the rest of the clinical picture. Option 5 is less likely because diabetic ketoacidosis is more typical of type 1 DM. Therefore the correct option is 1.\n",

The most appropriate approach in this case is:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\n2 and 4 are discarded alone. They are explaining erythema nodosum, so we would recommend relative rest (but antidepressants do not make any sense, so we also rule out (1)). Although erythema nodosum can be secondary to a malignant process, it is more frequent that it is due to Crohn's disease itself (moreover, in a 17-year-old boy it would be extremely rare), so if the picture is also accompanied by a flare-up of inflammatory bowel disease, the last option (5) seems the most correct.\n",
