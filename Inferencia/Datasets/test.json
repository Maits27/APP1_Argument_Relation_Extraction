        "context": "QUESTION TYPE: GENETICS AND IMMUNOLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \n2-year-old boy. His personal history includes 3 episodes of acute otitis media, 1 meningococcal meningitis and 2 pneumonias (one middle lobe and one left upper lobe). She has been admitted on 3 occasions for thrombopenic purpura (on three occasions antiplatelet antibodies were negative and bone marrow showed normal megakaryocytes). Several males of the maternal family had died in childhood due to infectious processes. Physical examination showed lesions typical of atopic dermatitis. The immunological study showed a slight decrease in T-lymphocyte subpopulations; elevated IgA and IgE; decreased IgM and IgG at the lower limit of normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nTo correctly answer this question it should be emphasized that among the symptomatology that is exposed we find: - 2-year-old child. - ENT infections. - Pulmonary infections. - Hospital admissions. - PTI. - Family history of infections with deaths due to infections in males (maternal family). - Atopic Dermatitis. All these data, in addition to the analytical data, are describing an immunodeficiency that by the family-maternal history, seems to be X-linked, as several males have died of a similar clinical condition (the father of the patient contributed the Y chromosome, the mother the X). Among the X-linked immunodeficiencies is Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an entity described with an initial triad of symptoms consisting of bleeding (typical BUT absent in the case: heavy bleeding after circumcision, bloody diarrhea), recurrent infections and eczema. In addition to thrombocytopenia, they are at increased risk for autoimmune phenomena and lymphoid neoplasms. The Hyper-IgE option lacks very characteristic clinical data such as bone alterations and skin lesions, which are not atopic dermatitis, since they follow a different pattern (papulopustular rash on the face and scalp). The option of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy and the common severe and variable combined immunodeficiency fails, among other features, the determination of immunoglobulins G and M, which are at the lower limit, but within normality.\n",

She consulted for intermittent scanty metrorrhagia of 2 months of evolution. The gynecological examination showed external genitalia without lesions, an atrophic cervix, a normal uterus and appendages on palpation and a normal cytological study of the cervix. The transvaginal ultrasound study shows a 7 mm hyperechogenic endometrium. Which of the following tests is the most appropriate and most sensitive to establish a diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThe correct answer is 3. The study that gives us more information about endometrial pathology is hysteroscopy, which allows us to perform a directed endometrial biopsy. Endometrial cytology is performed blindly and has a large number of false negatives. MRI will help us to stage endometrial cancer.\n",

        "context": "QUESTION TYPE: HEMATOLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 32-year-old woman with cerebral palsy from childbirth comes to the emergency department for a few days of dark urine associated with an episode of high fever and dry cough. On admission, the CBC showed 16900 leukocytes/mm3 (85% S, 11% L, 4% M), hemoglobin 6.3 g/dL; MCV 109 fl, 360000 platelets/mm3. In the biochemistry LDH 2408; bilirubin 6.8 mg/dl, (unconjugated bilirubin 6.1 mg/dl), normal GOT and GPT. The morphological study of blood showed macrocytic anisocytosis with frequent spherocytic forms and polychromatophilia without blasts. The irregular antibody study is positive for panagglutinin, making crossmatching difficult. What would be your suspicion and the most appropriate treatment?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nA long statement full of rather confusing data. We can attack that question in two ways: by looking at the key data and going all the way to the diagnosis we are considering or by discarding one by one. The choluria, LDH, presence of panagglutinin and the peripheral blood smear \"smells\" like hemolytic anemia. Answer 1 cannot be because a marrow aplasia does not explain the choluria, the elevation of LDH, nor in the study of irregular antibodies is positive in the form of panagglutinin; an aplasia is a marrow failure characterized by a total or partial disappearance of hemopoietic progenitors. In addition, pancytopenia is not observed, which is what would incline us more towards this pathology. Answer 2 is not possible either, since a spherocytosis does not justify the presence of panagglutinin. Answer 3 is the one I consider correct: an autoimmune hemolytic anemia would justify the data given: elevated LDH and bilirubinemia due to red cell destruction, polychromatophilia, spherocytosis and anisocytosis because the marrow is working hard to try to compensate for the anemia, which is regenerative. The study of irregular antibodies and the presence of panagglutinin also supports this response, since the binding of an antibody to the hematocyte promotes its lysis and destruction. The girl presents cough and fever, consistent with a respiratory infection. And the initial treatment is corticosteroids. This is confirmed by Sans Sabrafens in his book \"Clinical Hematology\" [1]. Answer 4 gives rise to considerable doubt; it is not possible because a pernicious anemia does not justify the presence of panagglutinin although it would justify the elevation of LDH and bilirubin; moreover, it is an intramedullary, arregenerative hemolysis, there is no reticulocytosis or release into the blood of immature forms in an attempt to compensate and fix the situation. Answer 5 is not true because no blasts are seen in the blood nor does it explain the presence of panagglutinin.\n",

She has never had any thrombotic phenomena. The determination of this factor was performed as a family study after an episode of pulmonary embolism in a sibling. What treatment should be advised?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nReading the answers, the first thing that is clear to us is that acenocoumarol should NOT be given to a pregnant woman because of the risk of teratogenicity. Anyone who does so during residency should be punished with 100 slaps on the back. We discard answer 5. Second: if treatment is given, it should be during the entire pregnancy, prothrombotic status is not only during the puerperium, so answer 2 discarded. Advise a woman not to become pregnant when there are treatments that ensure a very low risk of thrombosis and/or fetal involvement? Answer 1 discarded. We are left with the possibility of not giving any treatment because it is low risk or administering low-dose aspirin. It is true that factor V Leiden in heterozygosis is classified as low risk, who has not presented a previous thrombotic episode nor is there a combination with another thrombophilia; if we look at the CHEST guide, VIII edition and review what was said at the last congress of the Spanish Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics, we see that aspirin is used in case of phospholipid syndrome and that in the case of this woman, without previous thrombosis, without previous abortions (at least two are needed) and also being heterozygous, treatment is not necessary. Correct answer, 3.\n",

Chest X-ray shows a loculated right pleural effusion occupying two thirds of the hemithorax. During thoracentesis, a yellowish fluid is drawn and analysis shows: leukocytes 15,000/uL, 92% neutrophils, glucose 30 mg/dL, pH 7, lactate dehydrogenase 3500 U/L, adenosine deaminase 45 U/L and absence of germs on GRAM stain. What is the most appropriate next course of action in this patient?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nIn this question there should not be much doubt either (by the way, I think it is more of Pneumology than mine, but well, with this fever my friend Emilienko has deviated), since the clinical picture points to a parapneumonic pleural effusion, the macroscopic characteristics of the fluid seem so and the analysis of it shows us that the effusion is also complicated, almost on the verge of being an empyema (very high LDH, cellularity with predominance of PMN, glucose consumption). In addition, with this pH (and knowing that the effusion is already loculated), the endothoracic tube is more than indicated.\n",

She does not report visual disturbances, strength deficit, motor clumsiness or other symptoms. On examination she found anesthesia to pain and temperature in both hands and distal forearms; positional and vibratory sensitivity were preserved. There is no muscle atrophy or strength deficit. Muscle reflexes are normal and symmetrical. There is no dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia or intention tremor. The rest of the neurological examination is strictly normal. Indicate the most likely diagnosis in this case:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nThis year's Neurology section's burning question. He presents a diabetic patient on insulin treatment with good control (although diabetic neuropathies do not only develop in patients with poor control) with a sensory picture limited to the upper limbs and of short onset time, without motor symptoms or at any other level. In the examination there is a clear dissociation with thermoalgesic anesthesia and preservation of arthrokinetic and vibratory. Reflexes are normal, neither abolished nor exalted. In addition, the rest of the examination is strictly normal. With all this I believe that the correct answer is 5, that is a syringomyelic lesion, whose initial characteristic is the sensitive dissociation with anesthesia for the thermoalgesic and conservation of the posterior cord. MS and other spinal cord lesions would be accompanied by other exploratory signs such as exaltation of reflexes, for carpal tunnel the exploration exceeds the territory distal to the carpus, and as for answer 1, although there are forms of peripheral polyneuropathy \"pseudosyringomyelic\" they are usually of lumbar onset. The short evolution time (2 weeks), the respect of the lower limbs and the preservation of muscle reflexes make me rule out this response despite the distribution being \"glove-like\".\n",

The clinical manifestations worsen with nighttime weekend outings. An EEG shows acute polyp spike discharges at 6 cycles/second. The most likely diagnosis is:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nA patient of adolescent age with myoclonus (\"violent jumps\") at breakfast time will almost always lead us to juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (answer 5 correct), a very well characterized entity. Among other features is the previous history of seizures or absences, the worsening with nighttime departures, and the EEG with generalized polyp spike discharges at a higher frequency than that of absences. Of the remaining answers, Lennox Gastaut develops at an early age with other symptomatology, 4 is the same as absences, and 3 usually presents with complex partial seizures and either way, the EEG is clearly distinct from a temporal focus.\n",

She reports presenting, since 2 weeks ago, metamorphopsia and significant visual loss in her right eye that prevents her from reading. Indicate the most probable diagnosis:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nOf the five options, four could be compatible with the referred symptoms. We could initially rule out central serous chorioretinopathy because by definition it occurs in young people (up to 55 years of age, more or less). The key to differentiate between the other four is that he had soft drusen in the fundus. That while not a \"diagnosis\" (the question could have been better worded) is a finding related to age-related macular degeneration, or age-related macular degeneration. The dry or atrophic form presents with slowly progressive visual loss. But the wet or exudative form produces acute or rapidly progressive severe visual loss (usually due to subretinal hemorrhage accompanied by metamorphopsia (image distortion due to retinal lifting). An epiretinal membrane usually has a slower course. In a macular hole, visual loss is more relevant (metamorphopsia may also be reported, but it is less likely in the acute stage). In thrombosis of the central retinal vein, visual loss is more important and does not usually explain metamorphopsia (but may have it, due to macular edema).\n",

Lefort type I fracture does not affect the orbital contents. Knowing this information, the only correct answer is 2. If we were in doubt about whether or not Lefort's type I fracture affects the orbit, just look at the answers.

The anamnesis also highlights that she has lost interest in going out with friends, has ideas of death without self-harming ideation and pessimistic cognitions of the future. Her weight is 90% of that considered ideal for age and gender. She does not present weight phobia or body image distortion. The most appropriate diagnosis is:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nAs soon as we hear about weight we go to anorexia nervosa, but anorexia nervosa has three features: significant self-induced weight loss, body image distortion and amenorrhea. So we remove 1. One loses weight when one gets sad, worries, etc... 3 does not make sense in the MIR because of the clinic -in reality the history is different and in psychiatry everything is evolution-. 4 has to meet temporal criteria that are not met here. So we are between 2 and 5. Depression or anxiety? There is no anxiety clinic and she also meets the criteria for depression. The poor girl has been diagnosed with depression. The answer is 5 (another option is that she was studying the MIR).\n",

Hand X-ray shows an erosion in the styloid process of the ulna in the right carpus. Laboratory tests showed Hb: 10 g/dL with ESR of 45 mm in the first hour, CRP 16 mg/L, rheumatoid factor 160 IU/ML. After 6 months of treatment with indomethacin and methotrexate, the patient persists with pain and swelling of both carpals, morning stiffness lasting 30 minutes and a CBC showing an ESR 30 mm in the first hour and a CRP 9 mg/dL. Regarding the attitude to take, which of the following is true:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nThis is a patient with rheumatoid arthritis. In my opinion, as in these six months she has shown a clear clinical and biological improvement (decrease in acute phase reactants), I would maintain the therapeutic approach taken and wait for a new evaluation. However, I consider that this question could have another valid answer, 3. It depends a little on the attitude of each rheumatologist. If what you are looking for is a remission of the disease as soon as possible, you could choose to consider associating an anti-TNF alpha?\n",

Blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg. In the ECG, there are sharp and elevated T waves, ventricular extrasystoles and short QT. What is the most likely diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nThe correct answer is: 2. Hyperkalemia. Spironolactone, as a potassium-sparing diuretic, inhibits the action of aldosterone at the renal level, being responsible for a decrease in potassium excretion. Hyperkalemia produces repolarization disturbances that result in the installation of a large, symmetrical, narrow-based T, visible in the precordial leads. The QT space is shortened. These anomalies appear with a kalemia of around 5.5 to 6 mmol/l. Above 6.5 mmol/L, electrocardiographic changes are constant, and are dominated by conduction disturbances (making ventricular extrasystoles possible).\n",

The mucous membranes are respected. Your first diagnostic impression would be:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nAcute urticaria: characterized by erythematous-edematous, evanescent, pruritic, evanescent lesions, lasting less than 24 hours, without desquamation. The general condition is usually preserved. In children the annular pattern is more frequent. In both rubella and toxicoderma, the general condition is not preserved. In staphylococcal shock, the general condition is affected and the lesions are blistering. Scabies lesions are preferably interdigital, in the form of papulocoses that can follow linear trajectories.\n",

Androgens and platelet transfusions don't fix the problem either. We are left with the other three options. An autologous transplant is not reasonable, since the bone marrow of a patient with bone marrow aplasia is less than 25%, so little can be obtained. Therefore, we are inclined towards allogeneic bone marrow transplantation if he has an HLA-identical sibling, since this is the treatment of choice according to the protocol of the Spanish Society of Hematology and Hemotherapy for patients under 40 years of age with severe bone marrow aplasia.

In the last 5 years she gained weight, she has ecchymosis easily and arterial hypertension was detected. Physical examination: Obesity of central predominance, rounded facies, increased supraclavicular fat, decreased proximal muscle strength and some reddish striae in the abdomen. She has a blood glucose of 136 mg/dL and the radiological study showed osteoporosis and vertebral crushing. What do you think is the most coherent interpretation and attitude?\n3- Suggest Cushing's. Determine urinary free cortisol and basal ACTH, which serves to orient its etiology and select the most appropriate imaging technique.\n4- It looks like Cushing's. If basal ACTH is high, it may be due to corticosteroid use or an adrenal tumor, and an MRI should be performed.\n5- Probably has Cushing's. If the basal ACTH is low, he probably has a pituitary micro-adenoma, and a cranial CT scan should be performed.\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThis question is a bit convoluted for the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome but easy if the steps are clear. We all agree that the patient seems to have Cushing's syndrome (we rule out 1). For the diagnosis we have to measure urinary free cortisol, do a dexamethasone suppression test or measure nocturnal salivary cortisol. If hypercortisolism is confirmed, the origin should be sought; the ACTH measurement indicates the origin: suppressed in hypercortisolism of adrenal origin or prolonged use of corticoids and elevated or normal if the origin is pituitary or by ectopic ACTH secretion. (Therefore, 4 and 5 are false). If ACTH is low, a CT scan of the abdomen should be performed to locate the origin. If ACTH is normal or high, a pituitary MRI should be performed (pituitary adenomas responsible for Cushing's syndrome are very small and CT of the pituitary is less sensitive than MRI). It is very important to perform the order well to arrive at a proper diagnosis: 1st: confirm hypercortisolism or s. Cushing's syndrome, 2nd: measure ACTH to orient etiology. 3rd: imaging test according to ACTH levels. Therefore, answer 2 is false (abdominal CT is not a test to rule out s. Cushing's); an imaging test should only be done once a clear diagnosis of hypercortisolism has been made. Therefore, the true one is 3.\n",

No palpable lymphadenopathy. What tests would you order at the outset?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nIt refers to a thyroid nodule, and the indicated test is a FNA (fine needle puncture). I have read the answer Emilio has written on the challenge; the question is in the endocrine block and it seems he is trying to make it clear that it is a nodule. Ultrasound facilitates FNA but is not mandatory, a 2 cm thyroid nodule can be punctured without echo. It is important to have an analysis of thyroid function prior to the puncture; but since he is talking about an asymptomatic patient, it seems clear that she is not hyperthyroid. I do not think it is contested and I think it is a question that most will have answered well.\n",

Examination by organs and devices with no significant findings, highlighting good general condition. You were going to discharge him home but the Pediatrics attending on duty asks for a systematic urine and urine culture by catheterization. The urine shows leukocyturia ++, hematuria + and nitrites ++ and the urine Gram-negative bacilli are observed. In the blood analysis there is no leukocytosis and the C-reactive protein is 50 mg/l. The attending now tells you that the child does not need to be admitted and to prescribe an oral antibiotic. State the least appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment in this case:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nOther drugs are a good choice in urinary tract infections caused by large negative bacilli (most likely: E. coli). The presence of leukocytes + nitrites in the urine is very suggestive of UTI. And if the urine Gram detects G- bacteria, it is probably a UTI due to E Coli.

The patient reports that she underwent cervical conization for a high-grade intraepithelial lesion (H-SIL) and subsequently had three miscarriages between 20 and 22 weeks gestation. She has no living children. On all three occasions she came to the emergency department with a feeling of weight in the hypogastrium, where she was found to be 8 cm dilated and with prominent amniotic membranes. She had never felt contractions before, what advice would you give her for the next pregnancy?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThis is a typical case of cervical incompetence (and this patient has conization as a risk factor). This pathology consists of dilatation of the cervix in the absence of contractions, requiring cerclage to prevent miscarriage or immature delivery. The cerclage is ideally performed electively, programmed, and not when the patient arrives at the ER \"in extemis\" (which are also done, but with a lower success rate... the ideal is to do them cold).\n",

Laboratory tests showed creatinine 5 mg/dL, hemoglobin 10 g/dL and marked hypogammaglobulinemia in serum at the expense of IgG, IgA and IgM. A urinalysis reveals the presence of kappa light chains. What is your diagnostic suspicion?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nThis question is mixed hemato-nephro. It is complicated, so we are going to rule out options one by one. Option 2, nephrotic syndrome, apart from being broad and nonspecific, would not be assessable, since they do not give us the quantification of urine protein (they only tell us that urinalysis reveals the presence of kappa light chains, not the amount). Option 3 would be unlikely; in amyloidosis, the light chains that are usually deposited are of the lambda type. Option 4 also seems unlikely, since in IgA myeloma we would expect a monoclonal peak of this Ig, which in this case does not appear. The doubt that arises is between 1 and 5; I would opt for 1, because this entity fulfills the characteristics described (absence of monoclonal peak in most cases, acute renal failure and presence of kappa chains in urine), being light chain myeloma a somewhat broader entity, but option 5 could also be considered valid.\n",

Blood tests show creatinine 7 mg/dL, urea 250 mg/dL and high titer positive anti-GBM (anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies). Renal biopsy shows crescents in 75% of the glomeruli and immunofluorescence shows a linear Ig deposition pattern. Which of the following is the correct answer?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nThe diagnostic suspicion for the data given (especially the anti-GBM antibodies and the presence of renopulmonary syndrome) is that of Goodpasture's syndrome. The rest of the data (seminules in the biopsy, linear IgG deposition) supports the diagnosis. Knowing this, the options are easily discarded: option 1 speaks to us of an IgA nephropathy (it is not the case because the deposits are of IgG); option 3 is also discarded, because it is not a primary GMN, like the membranous one, but a secondary glomerulopathy; option 4 is also false: the initial treatment is with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide associated to plasmapheresis; and option 5 is also false, since the damage is not due to circulating immunocomplexes, but to antibodies deposited in the glomerular basement membrane. This leaves option 2 as true: as it has been previously said, the treatment would be performed combining corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis.\n",

On physical examination the patient was in good general condition, afebrile, normotensive and oriented in time and space. There were petechiae scattered throughout the lower extremities and abdomen and small ecchymoses in decubitus areas. No lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly were palpated. Laboratory tests showed the following findings: Hb 12.6 g/dL, leukocytes 5,500/mm3, platelets 7000/mm3. The peripheral blood smear showed normal erythrocyte morphology, normal differential leukocyte count and the planetary count was concordant with the autoanalyzer figure without platelet aggregates. Biochemistry and proteinogram, beta 2 microglobulin and LDH are normal. Which of the following do you think is the most appropriate initial treatment?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, but with very low platelets, so replenishment is necessary. The proposed steroid dose is too low.\n",

Her examination and MRI are normal. His treatment of choice would be:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nIn this question we are presented with a case to deduce a diagnosis and then indicate which would be the treatment of choice. Both the characteristics of the case and the answers suggest that it is a trigemino-autonomic headache (intense, periocular pain with lacrimation and rhinorrhea). The idea is to make a differential diagnosis mainly between a cluster headache (whose treatments include answers 2, 3, 4 and 5), a paroxysmal hemicrania (whose treatment of choice is the indomethacin of answer 1) and a SUNCT (unilateral neuralgiform headache with conjunctival injection and lacrimation). Cluster headache predominates in males whose duration can vary between 15-180 minutes, between once every 2 days, up to 8 times a day. Paroxysmal hemicrania predominates in women, with episodes of pain similar to cluster headache, but with a shorter duration (2-30 min), and a higher frequency (5-30 episodes per day). As for SUNCT, the crises are much shorter, lasting seconds (5-240 seconds) and are usually refractory to treatment. Therefore the diagnosis would be of a paroxysmal hemicrania and its treatment of choice is indomethacin (which also the answer is a diagnostic criterion). Therefore correct answer 1 (Indomethacin). All data provided are based on the Diagnostic Criteria of the International Headache Society.\n",

According to the patient, 3 weeks ago she had a sexual relationship that could be a risk for contracting the HIV virus. Indicate which of the following answers is true:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nA simple question if we are clear about the diagnostic process of HIV. At first glance, we could directly rule out answer 2 since we know that mononucleosis can be an expression of the first phase of HIV infection, especially when we have a history of a risk contact. Answers 3 and 4 are also easily ruled out; ELISA is a very sensitive but not very specific technique and confirmation with a Western-blot test is ALWAYS necessary. Answers 1 and 5 contradict each other if you notice, so one of the two is correct. In this case, the false answer is 1, it is a very categorical answer (\"rule out\") that does not quite fit the reality; As we have said, ELISA is a very sensitive technique, so a negative result could leave us quite calm, however, we all know that there is no medical test that rules out anything with total certainty (unless its sensitivity is 100%, which is not the case) and, on the other hand, we could say that in this case we have a high clinical suspicion (the picture is suggestive, and the antecedents are there). In addition, it is only 3 weeks since the contact, so our patient is probably in the \"window period\" during which serological techniques may be unprofitable. In conclusion, the answer that best fits us would be 5, in the window period a viral load may be indicated for diagnosis (positive if there are more than 10,000 copies), although this test is not done routinely.\n",

PTH determination was 45 pg/ml (VN 10-55 pg/ml). The history is unremarkable except for the fact that the mother and paternal grandfather were diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and underwent surgery, although they remained hypercalcemic. Which test is most useful in confirming the diagnosis?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nCalcium/creatinine urine ratio. This is familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia or benign familial hypercalcemia. Autosomal dominant disorder. Asymptomatic. Not cured after surgical treatment; it is due to mutation of the calcium-sensitive receptor. Difficult question since it is necessary to know data of a disease that is not usually asked in the MIR.\n",

He notes that his left eyelid is more droopy and that the pupil of this eye is smaller. John reports that the medial side of his left hand is numb and with less strength. His physician checks for palpebral ptosis and left miosis; he checks that he can close both eyelids symmetrically and that both pupils respond correctly to light. In addition, he checks that there is no sweating from the left hemiface, that he feels less prickling on the inner surface of the left hand and that he has less strength in the grip of the left hand. Regarding the ocular symptomatology, where is the lesion located?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nThe question would be more of neurology. It is a claude bernard horner syndrome and probably the correct one is 1. But for safety's sake it is better to have it checked by a neurologist.\n",

There is no arterial pulse in the hand measured by Doppler. What is the treatment of choice?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThe question is tricky: it speaks of a burn of 10% of the body surface and the treatment of choice for second degree burns less than 20% of the BSA should be topical and monitored. However, there is a warning sign: there is no arterial pulse and the burn is circumferential to the limb. This is an emergency that, if allowed to evolve, will compromise the viability of the affected limb and end in amputation: an emergency escharotomy must be performed in order to relieve the pressure of the third space on the arterial vascular trunk.\n",

On endoscopy, the mucosa showed no relevant features. In particular, no ulcers or friable areas were observed. A biopsy of the transverse colon was performed. Histopathology revealed a thickened area below the superficial lining epithelium, which was more evident by Masson's trichrome technique and involved epithelial atrophy and denudation. There was also a clear increase in intraepithelial lymphocyte density. The diagnosis of the intestinal lesion is?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nEverything we are told in this case is typical of COLLAGENOUS COLITIS. In principle, the clinical and endoscopic findings may leave us a little as at the beginning, but histology is little more than the definition of this pathology. The specific criterion for the diagnosis of collagenous colitis is the additional presence of an irregular band of collagen just below the surface epithelium of the colonic mucosa in continuity with the basement membrane, visible with trichrome staining (stains type I collagen fibers), which traps superficial capillaries producing lesions in the surface epithelium. In addition, it is accompanied by a chronic inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria, composed mainly of lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils.\n",

Which of the following diagnoses can cause this symptomatology?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nThis question could be controversial. Option 1 is strongly discarded because endophthalmitis typically presents with a lot of pain. Option 3 of wet form of age-related macular degeneration is also ruled out, because it usually occurs in older patients, although what a patient with myopia magna may present with is myopic macular degeneration (with a similar clinical picture to AMD, but this is a different pathology). A posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) is usually not very symptomatic, producing myodesopsias but no loss of vision or pain; however, some PVDs are of the hemorrhagic type, by traction of the vessels, producing a vitreous hemorrhage that would cause loss of vision. In any case, due to the history of myopia magna and previous intraocular surgery, the first diagnosis to rule out would be retinal detachment, since these are two risk factors for this pathology. Technically, both option 2 and 4 (an acute hemorrhagic DPV) could cause these symptoms, but the most correct option is option 2 (and I am sure it is the one the examiner wants answered).\n",

He follows treatment with delayed release morphine 200 mg/12 hours orally, kerosene and lactulose. For the last 15 days he has reported paresthesias and occasional lancinating pain in the right lumbar and periumbilical area that does not subside with rescue morphine. The neurological examination is normal. Indicate the most appropriate management:\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nWe have before us a patient with neuropathic pain, which due to the origin of the tumor, is most likely due to involvement of the celiac plexus. It is important to have a radiological diagnosis in view of a possible local treatment, such as neurolytic treatment or plexus blockade. However, we should not leave the patient without a treatment that can alleviate but rather solve the current situation. He is taking WHO step 3 analgesia, which is clearly insufficient, so he will need adjuvants; although opioids for neuropathic pain are not very effective, we will not reduce the dose but will associate the adjuvants. We would manage the patient with gabapentin and corticosteroids (true answer 4); we would not decrease the dose of morphine (false answer 3), and in the meantime we would ask for a CT scan (or abdominal MRI) to subsequently assess the plexus block (answers 1 and 2 for future management).\n",

According to the SEGO (Spanish Society of Gynecology and Obstetrics) in its 2005 protocol \"Gestational trophoblastic disease\", the risk of malignization, i.e. of developing a gestational trophoblastic neoplasm, ranges from 5 to 20% depending on whether it is a partial mole or a complete mole, respectively. According to this protocol: \"Patients will be monitored weekly with hcg dosage until it becomes undetectable, for three consecutive times. After that the monitoring will be monthly, for six months and then every two months for another six months. Based on the available data, a follow-up of three to six months is recommended for partial mole and 12 months for complete mole.\" Therefore, subsequent controls are strictly necessary.The risk of a new molar gestation, although increased compared to the normal population, is not 50%.\n",

Hypotensive and afebrile. She presented right ophthalmoparesis due to involvement of the third cranial nerve. A cranial CT scan shows a mass in the hyperdense selar region with erosion of the anterior clinoid processes. What is the best approach to follow?\n5- Lumbar puncture to rule out bacterial meningitis after starting empirical antibiotherapy. Once the patient was stabilized, study of the selar mass.\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nPituitary apoplexy is a syndrome characterized by the sudden onset of headache accompanied by ocular motility disturbances and a variable degree of pituitary insufficiency. The cause is usually a rapidly growing pituitary mass secondary to a vascular event (infarction or hemorrhage). General symptoms may range from vomiting or nausea to meningeal irritation. Compression on the chiasm and optic nerve can cause various campimetric deficits (usually greater bitemporal hemianopsia in the superior quadrants) and decreased visual acuity, even blindness. If the mass grows lateral to the sella turcica it can compress the oculomotor nerves, with the common motor ocular nerve being the most frequently affected, because of its more medial course in the cavernous sinus. The test of choice for the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy is MRI, as CT may not distinguish the region clearly enough to distinguish degenerative or cystic changes from previous bleedings. The finding of erosion of the anterior clinoid processes in the skull CT may support a chronic lesion, which as a result of an acute vascular phenomenon has caused the symptoms. The management of these patients involves strict control of water and electrolyte disturbances and correction of hormonal deficits. In unstable situations as in the case described, with significant visual disturbances, surgical intervention is usually of choice, with transsphenoidal decompression.\n",

Indeed, the physical examination shows a Tanner stage IV, with no growth of pubic or axillary hair. The external genitalia are normal. Ultrasonography reveals a small uterus and radiology reveals a bone age of 3 years. What attitude should be adopted?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nIt seems that they want to present us with precocious puberty (or premature telarche) but they do not provide any analytical data and the ultrasound data are ambiguous (we should assume that by a small uterus they are referring to a prepubertal uterus, but they do not provide any data on ovarian size). We are presented with the case of a three-year-old girl with advanced mammary development, in principle without any associated cause (in principle she does not take drugs that can increase the level of estrogen in the blood, she does not seem to use body creams or eat a lot of chicken meat). If we follow the diagnostic scheme for a premature telarche or suspicion of precocious puberty, we request bone age and abdominal ultrasound (the EO is not advanced as in precocious puberty, and we assume that with a small uterus they mean a prepubertal uterus); according to the complementary examinations that we are given, it does not seem to be precocious puberty, except for the clinical (Tanner IV). Strictly speaking, without analytical hormonal data, it seems that we could mark option 1, being necessary to follow the girl closely. If we take all the above data for granted, we could rule out option 4, which would be the treatment of a central precocious puberty. Regarding the option of mammography, breast ultrasound is used in pediatrics, and in this case it would be indicated if we were told that there is breast asymmetry (we discard option 3). Regarding breast biopsy, it would only be indicated if there are warning signs.\n",

She was prescribed 10 mg of escitalopram and was evaluated 2 weeks later. In this review the patient reports feeling very well, she wakes up early very hyperactive and with 'a lot of desire to do things', she says she has a lot of energy and is more talkative than usual. She does not report being irritable and is able to sleep for 6 hours continuously. Given this situation, what would you think the patient has?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nIn this question, one might suspect the possibility of an affective shift after the introduction of the antidepressant drug, according to the patient, but if we look at the patient's ability to maintain sleep, there is a clear fact that \"rules out\" the hypo/manic shift. Two weeks is not enough time for the drug to have taken full effect on mood, but an initial activation may appear, which patients sometimes do not cope with very well (something that does not seem to be the case). In this patient it is indicated to maintain the treatment and reevaluate in no more than one month.\n",

What test would you request first for diagnostic purposes?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nThis is a woman with abrupt, painless and severe loss (she only sees the movement of the hands) of vision in one eye. She does not give us much information from the ocular examination, only that there is an afferent pupillary defect. We have to rely on systemic symptoms to diagnose the problem. This is an elderly woman with typical symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica, and the pain in the temporomandibular region is very suggestive. It is giant cell arteritis or temporal arteritis. The most common ocular manifestation is anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. In the fundus we would certainly see a papillary edema of that eye, with a gypsum white coloration. The afferent pupillary defect is very characteristic of these severe ischemic optic neuropathies. Suspecting giant cell arteritis, there are three analytical markers that are characteristically high: CRP, ESR and platelet count. We will first request one of these parameters and treat it often without waiting for biopsy confirmation. Therefore, option 2 is the correct one.\n",

The analytical data suggest diabetes insipidus (high plasma osm with low urinary osm). Now we must differentiate between central diabetes insipidus (lack of ADH) or nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (ADH does not exert its action at the renal level).

He has a dog that bit him 24 hours ago and has caused a small wound on his right hand. He went to his health center (located 3 hours from the nearest hospital) for fever of 39ºC, pain in the wound and general malaise. On examination, BP 100/60 mm Hg, HR 110 beats per minute, slight swelling in the wound without pus. Which of the following actions is most indicated at this time?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nSince a splenectomized patient is considered a \"special\" patient, he should receive antibiotic treatment as soon as possible, even if the wound does not appear infected. It is necessary to make sure that the dog is yours (you should ask if the animal is correctly vaccinated) and if the patient is correctly vaccinated (5 doses of tetanus, it would not require tetanus); make a notification of Animal Aggression, for observation of this and take measures in case this is necessary.\n",

She starts with a high fever with chills, headache, myalgia and non-productive cough that she interprets as a flu-like process. She presented with chest pain. Chest X-ray showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in lower fields. A serologic test was performed with elevated titers of antibodies against phase II antigens. Which of the following statements is TRUE?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nAs a possible disease I would consider Brucellosis, typical of cattle (milk, abortion, genital secretions...). It presents with a pseudo-flu-like symptomatology (headache, arthralgias, myalgias, fever...) and other symptoms depending on the route of entry. In our case, when attending animal births, the entry is through the respiratory route, so the pulmonary infiltrates and chest pain are due to the bacteria. The treatment varies according to the affectation and mortality is very low, almost null. Morbidity and involvement in pregnant women are of greater concern. Important: it is very frequent in livestock workers (veterinarians, farmers, slaughterhouses...) if you read something like \"attends births of livestock animals\", \"works on a farm\", \"is a veterinarian\" suspect Brucellosis.\n",

On arrival at the hospital he has hypotension (systolic BP 80 mmHg, diastolic 40 mmHg) and poor perfusion. He is intubated and connected to mechanical ventilation and noradrenaline is started. Echocardiogram shows signs of pulmonary hypertension. Angio-CT shows multiple repletion defects occupying both main pulmonary arteries. Which of the following treatments would be associated with the most rapid hemodynamic improvement in this case? \n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nThe patient presented pulmonary thromboembolism which, in addition to being bilateral, produced severe hemodynamic involvement, shock and required mechanical ventilation. We are not told that he has any contraindication to fibrinolysis, so this would be the most appropriate option due to its rapid administration and action. Sodium heparin is reserved for cases in which the patient is stable. Thromboendarterectomy could be performed urgently in selected centers (not available in all) in patients in whom systemic fibrinolysis is contraindicated, or in centers where the experience with this technique is proven and it can be performed quickly. The inferior vena cava filter is a treatment indicated in the acute phase in stable patients, when anticoagulation is contraindicated; or a posteriori, as prophylaxis, in this group of patients. The indications for fibrinolysis in the last SEPAR consensus document included patients at intermediate risk (they could benefit from it) and high risk. They classify intermediate risk as PESIs ≥ 1 or PESI III-IV. In this subgroup, patients with right ventricular dysfunction, troponin or BNP above the cutoff and deep vein thrombosis appear to benefit most from fibrinolysis. In the subgroup of high-risk patients (defined by hypotension or cardiogenic shock criteria), the use of systemic fibrinolysis is much clearer, as in the case presented in the question.\n",

She consults for unbearable pain in the right knee of 5 days of evolution, without previous trauma. Examination: globular knee, moderate varus, extension and flexion limited by pain, diffuse medial pain. X-ray shows osteophytes and mild impingement of the medial interlining. What would be his initial management?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nWe are being described an acute pain crisis in a patient with gonarthrosis. In this situation, the first thing to do is to resolve the pain crisis and to propose an appropriate conservative treatment for this osteoarthritis (1 correct). A knee arthroplasty is not considered at the outset, so 2 is false. They are not telling us an infectious clinic to suspect an arthritis that would justify a debridement and washing so 3 is false. In a patient with gonarthrosis there will always be meniscopathy, it is part of the degenerative changes. Baker's cyst would only interest us in a severe pain crisis in the differential diagnosis with a deep thrombosis and it is evaluated with an echo-Doppler, in the picture of gonarthrosis it has no value to detect a Baker's cyst. Tendinitis is diagnosed by examination, not with MRI. Therefore, 4 is false.\n",

        "context": "QUESTION TYPE: ORTHOPEDIC SURGERY AND TRAUMATOLOGY\nCLINICAL CASE: \nA 70-year-old woman, diabetic and hypertensive, who suffers a fall at home, presenting a 9 cm wound communicating with a fracture site of the right tibia. Radiographically, a short oblique fracture of the mid-distal third of the tibia was observed. An emergency operation was performed by cleaning (Friederich) and placement of an endomedullary steel-plated nail. At 11 months he presents with atrophic pseudarthrosis of the tibia with suppuration in the wound area. What will be his best immediate therapeutic option?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe first thing is to treat the infection and for this we must remove all the osteosynthesis material, debride and give antibiotherapy. Fixation in this case is better external to avoid all the material around the affected area, so 4 is correct and 1 and 2 is not. The 3 would be considered after expiration of the infectious picture. TREATMENT - Suppressive antibiotic treatment: indicated in patients with Ciemy type C, it consists of prolonged oral antibiotic therapy for at least 6 months to \"cool\" the exacerbation of the clinical picture. - Curative treatment: includes a first surgery with aggressive tumor-like debridement of all affected tissues, profuse irrigation, stabilization with external fixator if stability is compromised, and eventual filling of the cavities with antibiotic-releasing substances. After prolonged periods of antibiotic therapy selected according to the antibiograms of the cultures, and once it is certain that the infection has been cured, special techniques for the reconstruction of the bone defect and to achieve adequate coverage of soft tissues should be considered. We are dealing with an infection associated with an implant (intramedullary nail) and pseudoarthrosis of the tibia fracture (absence of union after 11 months). The infection is understood by the clinical manifestations (suppuration, nonunion) and the history of diabetes and open fracture. Management overlaps with the management of chronic osteomyelitis. Isolated antibiotherapy (option 2) is indicated only in patients with severe comorbidity in whom surgical treatment would be more aggressive than continuing the disease. Nail dynamization associated with broad-spectrum antibiotherapy (option 1) is not indicated either, because (a) it has not demonstrated benefit in established pseudarthrosis and (b) we have the same issue as option 1, we do not eliminate biofilm. Option 3, discussed, would be considered only if there was no associated infection.\n",

After responding favorably to treatment with analgesics and oxygen, he begins to present severe hypoxemia. Indicate the most probable cause of this deterioration:\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nPulmonary contusion is the most serious lesion and the one with the worst prognosis in thoracic trauma. It is also the injury that causes hypoxemia the earliest. Contrary to what we may think, an unstable thorax due to multiple rib fractures (costal volet) would cause progressive hypoventilation with atelectasis of the pulmonary parenchyma, which would progress on the one hand to hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, and on the other, to later hypoxemia due to infection associated with atelectasis. Respiratory infection due to aspiration would also occur later, and does not appear in all cases of severe chest trauma, only if there has been a decrease in the level of consciousness (associated TBI, uncontrolled intubation with bronchoaspiration...). Post-traumatic hypovolemia (in this case, as there are multiple rib fractures, it could be due to hemothorax) would occur earlier and would be associated in the first place with hemodynamic instability.\n",

Which of the following genetic tests would be routinely used for the diagnosis of this patient: \n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThis question may be a little more difficult, as the clinical case presented to us is very vague. An adolescent with pubertal delay and short stature; nothing more. With this information, she could have several genetic pathologies, but this is the MIR and we are told that the patient does not have an intellectual disability. In the MIR, an adolescent with pubertal delay and short stature should be a Turner until proven otherwise (there were two questions in 2017). Therefore, if that is our first diagnostic suspicion, the HABITUAL test (as the statement says) for diagnosis should be a conventional karyotype (formula: 45, X0). A Turner can also be diagnosed with a FISH (there would only be one signal for the X instead of the two that females usually have) or with an array. However, both array and NGS are usually reserved for patients with non-obvious clinical pictures, intellectual disability, or suspicion of a genetic syndrome that requires these specific tests (for example, an array to diagnose a 22q11 deletion syndrome or an NGS panel to diagnose a Noonan syndrome).\n",

Examination: axillary temperature 37.2°C, respiratory rate 40 rpm, heart rate 160 bpm, blood pressure 90/45 mmHg, SatO2 95% on room air. He shows moderate respiratory distress with intercostal and subcostal retraction. Pulmonary auscultation: scattered expiratory rhonchi, elongated expiration and slight decrease in air entry in both lung fields. Cardiac auscultation: no murmurs. It is decided to keep the patient under observation in the hospital for a few hours. What do you consider the most appropriate attitude at this time with regard to the complementary tests?\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe patient probably presents with bronchiolitis. At this stage, no additional tests should be performed unless there is a clinical worsening.\n",

She has a BMI of 31 kg/m2 and presents poor glycemic control despite a program of non-pharmacological measures (healthy diet, exercise). Which of the following hypoglycemic drugs is associated with weight gain and should we avoid in this patient?:\n3- Canagliflozin (sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor- iSGLT2).\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 2\nA somewhat more complicated question than the previous one. Regarding weight, metformin to a lesser extent, SGLT-2 inhibitors and, above all, GLP-1 agonists have been associated with a significant decrease in weight in patients with DM-2 (answers 1,3 and 4 incorrect). On the other hand, pioglitazone, as reflected in its data sheet, can produce dose-dependent weight gain, mainly due to fat accumulation and added, in some cases, to water retention.\n",

On consultation she presented with blood pressure of 149/100 mmHg. Laboratory tests: creatinine 1.2 mg/dl, potassium 2.2 mEq/l and compensated metabolic alkalosis; the rest of the biochemical study, blood count, coagulation and urinary sediment were normal. Point out the correct statement:\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 3\nWe are presented with a patient with resistant arterial hypertension, assuming that he has primary hyperaldosteronism due to hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis. When the diagnosis is biochemically confirmed, the next test to be performed is a CT scan to determine the subtype and rule out the presence of an adrenal carcinoma (option 3 correct). Therefore, it is necessary to wait for the imaging test to confirm the etiology (option 1 incorrect). The most frequent cause is aldosterone-producing adenoma (option 2 incorrect). Spironolactone is the medical treatment of choice (option 4 incorrect).\n",

Lately she has had headaches and visual problems that she notices in class and when studying. She has not had menarche or polydipsia or polyuria. Parents with normal height. Examination: short stature at -2.1 standard deviations, normal body proportions, little pubic hair and breast development. Campimetry shows left temporal partial hemianopsia. Bone age: delay of 2 years. General laboratory tests were normal. Gonadotrophins (FSH and LH) and estradiol are low. What do you think is the most appropriate response?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nAnswer 2 is false (Turner syndrome: low estradiol and elevated gonadotrophins), brain tumors affecting the hypothalamus-pituitary gland do not give low gonadotrophins (5 false), and it seems obvious that refractive defects do not give hemianopsia (3 and 4 false).\n",

There is heterogeneity in the development of Alzheimer's disease symptoms. There are behavioral variants, but in the MIR they usually want you to think of other types of dementias in the face of behavioral symptoms. In fact, the appearance of these symptoms in early stages should alert us and open the range of diagnostic possibilities. Therefore, we discard 2 and 4.

A cranial CT scan was performed showing a fracture of the middle third of the face involving the orbito-malar region. One of the most frequent complications of this type of fracture is:\n5- nan\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nFractures of the midface in the orbito-malar region may involve the floor and, to a lesser extent, the lateral wall of the orbit. Assuming therefore that we are asked which is one of the most frequent complications of the floor of the orbit, two complications should always be highlighted that may indicate surgical treatment, even urgent: diplopia, due to dislocation of the inferior rectus muscle to the underlying maxillary sinus (and even its entrapment); and enophthalmos, which may cause other associated complications in the medium and long term, such as superior palpebral pseudo-ptosis due to loss of orbital volume (option 4 correct). Temporomandibular ankylosis is not considered because, although relatively close to the orbital cavity, it is not part of the orbito-malar complex (option 1 discarded). Involvement of the maxilla can lead to dental malocclusion, but usually occurs in fractures located lower than the orbital cavity (option 2 discarded). Naso-ethmoidal fractures are included in midface fractures, but the bones of the nose are located more anteriorly to the medial orbital rim, and therefore outside the orbit (option 3 discarded).\n",

She has AP of hypertension, LBP, moderate dementia and lives in a nursing home. Her usual treatment is thiazide, atorvastatin, donepezil, Calcium and vitamin D. EF: Confused patient, pulse 90 bpm, respiratory rate 20 rpm, T art 170/88, jugular venous pressure normal. The CBC and chest X-ray are normal and the ECG shows sinus rhythm without ischemic alterations. Which of the following is the most correct therapeutic approach?\nCORRECT ANSWER: 4\nThe confusional picture is determined by the dementia that the patient already suffers, so no matter how much we delay surgery, we are not going to achieve anything. The elevation of blood pressure is due, in principle, to pain (so the first option is an analgesic) and then to the stressful situation that leads an already hypertensive patient to increase her blood pressure, so labetalol could help us. The last answer is not correct because it depends on the type of fracture, which is not specified in the statement: a pertrochanteric fracture would require closed osteosynthesis and a subcapital fracture would require a prosthesis.\n",

PaO2 is 55 mm Hg (PaO2/FiO2 ratio<200). CXR shows bilateral alveolar pulmonary infiltrates. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is normal. Oxygen therapy does not improve the situation. What is the most probable diagnosis:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nDirect response question. The question tells the story of a patient with acute pancreatitis who is developing acute respiratory failure. The statement lists the criteria for ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome): PaO2/fiO2 < 200 + bilateral pulmonary infiltrates + PCP<18. So the diagnosis is respiratory distress and therefore the correct answer is option 5.\n",

His maternal grandmother also suffered from colon cancer. The biopsies are superficial and show a poorly differentiated tumor with abundant inflammatory cells in the stroma that is diagnosed as a medullary type carcinoma.\nCORRECT ANSWER: 5\nComplicated question about an unusual adenocarcinoma. By rule 1 would be easy to eliminate, the treatment of colon cancer is surgical (with neoadjuvant in rectal cancer). If biopsies confirm adenocarcinoma, there is no need to repeat them, since it is necessary to have the complete specimen. Most colon cancer develops on adenomas, so we could eliminate this one. Among the other 2, it is important to know that 5 is correct since they almost always present microsatellite instability even without fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria and have a better prognosis than other poorly differentiated colon cancer.\n",

She does not refer to risky sexual behaviors or epidemiological history of risk of viral hepatitis. She does not consume alcohol or hepatotoxic drugs. She reports a one-year history of generalized pruritus, asthenia, dry mouth and absence of lacrimation with no known cause. Rest of the anamnesis without pathological data. Physical examination showed scratching lesions, conjunctival jaundice and non-painful hepatomegaly. The patient brings a blood test carried out in his company with the following pathological results: Bilirubin 3 mg/dl, FA 400 UI/ VSG 40mm 1 hour. Indicate which would be the best recommendation to establish the etiological diagnosis of the patient's condition:\nCORRECT ANSWER: 1\nBook picture of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, one of those that do not occur in real life. The diagnosis would be practically made with the AMA (1). With 2 we would rule out hemochromatosis, with 3 we would rule out Wilson's disease. With 4 we could rule out rare diseases such as biliary tract malformations or Caroli's disease and with 5 we could rule out viral hepatitis.\n",
